</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> notes on which these essays are based were
collected in the course of two commissions spent
under the lee of the Admiralty library, close to the
Royal United Service Institution, and in touch with the
Reading Room of the British Museum and other public sources
of information.</p>

<p>The lack of a book describing in popular language the
materialistic side of naval history is, I think, generally
admitted. Historians as a rule have devoted small space to
consideration of material; in particular, the story of the
revolutionary changes in naval material which took place
during the nineteenth century has never been placed before
the public in convenient form. In the attempt to supply such
a description I have taken the liberty, as an engineer, of treating
of naval material as a whole; tracing, as well as my
technical knowledge permits, the progress of all the three
principal elements—ship, gun, engine—and their interdependence.
The result, faulty and incomplete as it is, may
nevertheless be of considerable service, it is hoped, in clarifying
the work of the historians and bridging the gap which divides
the classic histories from our modern text-books.</p>

<p>I have considered our modern navy to begin with the
“Admiral” class of battleship, about the year 1880.</p>

<p>My respectful thanks are due to the heads of three Admiralty
departments: Captain R. H. Crooke, C.B., lately Director of
Naval Ordnance; Engineer Vice-Admiral Sir George Goodwin,
K.C.B., LL.D., Engineer-in-Chief of the Fleet; and Sir Eustace
T. D’Eyncourt, K.C.B., Director of Naval Construction; for
their unofficial approval. I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness
to the officials of the Admiralty and the R.U.S.I. libraries,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
for their invariable kindness; to the Directors of the British and
S. Kensington Museums, for permission to reproduce pictures
in their possession; to Mr. A. W. Johns, C.B.E., Assistant
Director of Naval Construction, Engineer Commander E. C.
Smith, O.B.E., R.N., Mr. H. W. Dickinson, of the S. Kensington
Museum, Mr. Edward Fraser, and Sir George Hadcock,
F.R.S., R.A., of Elswick, for various help and criticism; and
especially to Mr. L. G. Carr Laughton, of the Admiralty
library, of whose advice and knowledge I have often availed
myself, and to whose encouragement the completion of the
work has been largely due.</p>

<p>It only remains to state that the whole of the book is written
and published on my own responsibility, and that it is in no
manner or degree an official publication.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">To</span> attempt to trace in any detail the evolution of
the sailing warship is a task, it must be at once
admitted, far beyond the scope and intention of the
present essay.</p>

<p>The history of naval architecture is, of course, a vast and
many-sided subject. Few are the writers who have dealt with
it, and, for reasons which will appear, few of those have written
in the English language. Such books as treat of it are too
cumbrous and technical for easy reading; they are not written
in the modern style; by the frequent digressions of their
authors on matters of general history, high politics, battles,
economics, commerce, and even sport, they bear witness to the
difficulties of the task and the complexity of the subject. The
history of naval architecture still remains to be written. In the
meantime the student will find the monumental <cite>Marine
Architecture</cite>, of Charnock, and the smaller <cite>Naval Architecture</cite>,
of Fincham, invaluable fields of inquiry; among the historians
the works of Nicolas, Laughton, Corbett and Oppenheim, will
furnish him with the materials for the complete story of the
evolution up to the end of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The following pages give a sketch, drawn chiefly from these
authors, of the progress of the timber-built sailing ship and of
the principal influences which guided the evolution. Lessons
may still be drawn from this history, it is suggested, which
even in the altered circumstances of to-day may be of value in
some other application. One lesson, long unlearnt, the great
blunder of two centuries, lies clearly on the surface. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
evidence will show how, by our long neglect of the science of
naval architecture, the British navy fought frequently at an
unnecessary disadvantage; but it will also show how, masters
of the art of shipbuilding, we gave our fleets such a superiority
in strength and seaworthiness as almost to neutralize the
defects inherent in their general design.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>Before the fourteenth century the sailing ship, i.e. the ship in
which sails were used as the chief motive power, could not
compete in battle on equal terms with the oar-driven vessel;
both in the Mediterranean and in Northern waters the oar-driven
galley possessed advantages of speed and handiness
which relegated the heavy, high-built and capacious sailing
ship to the position of a mere transport or victualler. The
fighting ships were the galleys: long speedy vessels with fine
lines and low freeboard, propelled by rowers and fought by
soldiers clad in mail and armed with swords and lances. Sails
were carried, but only as secondary power, for use when the
galleys ran before the wind.</p>

<p>Sea tactics consisted in ramming and boarding; the vessels
were designed accordingly. The royal galleys of King Henry
III, which formed the fighting fleet of Hubert de Burgh, are
described as having each two tiers of oars, with platforms
along each side over the heads of the rowers, on which the
soldiers stood. Hung on the bulwarks in front of them were
their shields. From the gaudily painted mast pennons and
banners floated on the wind; a large square cotton sail,
embroidered with the royal arms, was triced to the yard. The
masthead was crowned with a circular “top,” a repository
for bricks and iron bars wherewith to bilge an enemy vessel.
At both ends of the galley were raised platforms or “castles”
filled with picked soldiery, who during the approach to action
would pour brass-winged arrows into the enemy and who,
when the enemy had been grappled, leaped aboard. From
mechanical engines low down in the waist large stones would
be projected, and, if on the windy side, quicklime would be
thrown, and other “instruments of annoyance.” The galleys
were lightly built, and carried no pumps. It was no uncommon
sight, we are told, to see half the knights baling, while the
others fought hand-to-hand with the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
By the year 1300 the size and utility of ships had made considerable
advance. Two masts were given them, each supported
by a few shrouds and carrying a single large square sail;
neither masts nor sails were yet subdivided, but the sails could
be enlarged by having one or more “bonnets” laced to their
lower part. Of the two masts the taller, the foremast, raked
considerably over the bows, and both were surmounted by
tops, with flagstaff and streamers. A central rudder appeared
in this century, in place of the paddle fixed to the quarter, and
a rudimentary bowsprit. The largest <em>cogs</em>, as they were now
called, were of 250 tons burthen. When hired of merchants
for war service, they were converted by the addition of fore-, aft-, and
top-castles, built high so as to overtop, if possible, the
enemy. The war vessels were at this time lavishly decorated;
the sails were silk, dyed red or embroidered with armorial
designs, the tops and stages were aflame with banners and
pennons, the masts and yards were gilt. Large sums of money
were spent by the knights in beautifying their ships.</p>

<p>But in this century two great inventions brought to a close an
epoch in warship construction. Gunpowder and the mariner’s
compass were discovered. Cannon were adapted to ships in
place of the mechanical engines which had formerly been
carried, and by aid of the compass, housed in its wood-pegged
bittacle in the steerage, vessels began to venture out of touch
with land and sail with a new security the uncharted ocean.</p>

<p>The effect of each of these two discoveries was the same: a
growth in the size, strength, and capacity of ships, a decline in
the use of oars and a greater reliance on sails. High sides were
required against the waves, stouter timbers to support the
weight of ordnance, more capacious holds for the stowage of the
ballast, food, and cordage which would be needed for a long sea
voyage. The galley, with its low flush deck and outward-sloping
sides was ill adapted for the new conditions; a new
construction was seen to be needed. Two new types were
evolved, one in the Mediterranean and one, more gradually, in
Atlantic waters.</p>

<p>Even before the Christian era there had been a distinct
differentiation between the ships of the Mediterranean and
those of the Atlantic seaboard. The latter, as shown by
Nicolas’ quotation from Cæsar, were more strongly built than
the Roman galleys, with flatter bottoms, to “adapt them to the
shallows and to sustain without danger the ebbing of the tide,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
and with prows and sterns “very high and erect, to bear the
hugeness of the waves”: properties which, even before the
advent of fire artillery, conferred on them important advantages.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
Nevertheless, complete differentiation did not obtain
until after the discovery of gunpowder and the mariner’s
needle. Before that time the vessels used by the Northern
nations in war were of the galley type, built by themselves or,
after the Crusades had revealed the superiority of the Mediterranean
powers in warship design, hired not infrequently
from Venetians or from Genoese. The Genoese were the chief
naval mercenaries of Europe at this age: “Genoese were
vice-admirals to the English king, and Genoese galleys fought
for the French at Sluys.”</p>

<p>The new type evolved in the Mediterranean was the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">galleasse</i>.
For centuries, as we have seen, large sailing ships had been
used for commerce, both in the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean.
With the inevitable increase in size brought about by
the adoption of cannon, and by the desire for greater sea-keeping
qualities, resort was now had by the Genoese and
Venetians to sails in war vessels as a means of propulsion of
equal importance with oars. Thus an uncomfortable compromise
was effected between oars and sails; both were
provided. The galleasse was originally a large decked galley,
with three pole masts for its lateen sails, and with cannon
spaced at intervals along its sides above the rowers. In form
it differed little from the galley, but in the disposition of its
armament it was entirely different; it represented the first
stage in the evolution of the broadside fighting ship.</p>

<p>But the galleasse, though it might meet the requirements of
Mediterranean warfare, was almost as unsuited as the galley
to Atlantic conditions. Accordingly the warship underwent a
separate and independent development at the hands of the
Atlantic nations. Forsaking the galley, they took the lofty,
strong and capacious sailing merchant ship as the basis of a
new type, and from the lumbering carrack and caravel and
dromon they evolved the vessel which eventually became
known as the <em>galleon</em>. A distinctive naval architecture, Gothic
rather than Byzantine in character, was thus founded on the
Atlantic seaboard. The oar was entirely superseded by the
sail. The ships were high, and their sides, instead of falling out
like those of galleys, were curved inwards so as to “tumble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
home” above the water-line: an arrangement which protected
the ordnance, added to the strength of the vessels, and tended
to render them steadier gun-platforms. The top-castles were
retained on the masts, but the end-castles disappeared, or
rather, were incorporated into the structure of the lofty bow
and stern, to provide accommodation for officers, and cover for
the crew. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">voile latine</i> gave way to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">voile quarrée</i>. In
place of the large lateen sails carried by galley and galleasse,
were smaller sails and courses, square, more easily manipulated
and allowing of greater variation in disposition and effective
area, to suit the conditions of weather and the trim of the ship.</p>

<p>Throughout the fifteenth century the sailing ship developed.
“While in the first quarter,” writes Mr. Oppenheim of English
shipping, “we find that men-of-war possess, at the most, two
masts and two sails, carry three or four guns, and one or two
rudimentary bowsprits, at the close of the same century they
are three- or four-masters, with topmasts and topsails, bowsprit
and spritsail, and conforming to the characteristics of
the type which remained generally constant for more than two
centuries.” The English mariner had by this time acquired
his honourable reputation. In merchant ships he carried
Bordeaux wine, the casks of which became the unit for measurement
of their tunnage; even in winter months, we are told,
he braved the Bay with pilgrims on tour to the shrine of
St. James of Compostella. Large royal ships of over 1000
tons burthen were built, in the early part of the century, in
English yards. As builders the Normans seem at this time
to have excelled.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> But the most wonderful development of
the science of seamanship in all its branches took place in the
Peninsula. Largely through the inspiration of one man the
greatest efforts of Spain and Portugal were directed to the
cult of navigation and geography, the improvement of shipbuilding,
and the discovery of new and distant lands and
oceans. A brilliant impetus was given to the study of ship
construction by the voyages of Columbus, the Cabots, Vasco
di Gama, and other intrepid spirits who, by aid of the compass,
braved the moral and physical terrors of far-distant voyages—“fighting
immensity with a needle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>With the development of artillery the value of the sailing
ship for sea warfare came gradually to view. Naval tactics
suffered a complete change.</p>

<p>Until the early days of the sixteenth century sea-fights had
been land-fights in character; ships came as quickly as
possible to close quarters, grappled or charged one another,
cut rigging, and essayed to board. The sailor was subservient
to the soldier. The gun, represented in the main by serpentines,
periers, murderers, and other quick-firing pieces, was
primarily a defensive armament, for the defence, firstly, of
the entire ship, or, in the event of the waist being captured,
of the fortified end citadels or castles. “These castles, which
in vessels especially constructed for war came to take the form
of a forecastle and a half-deck, were made musket-proof; and
being closed athwartship with similarly protected bulkheads,
known as ‘cubbridge-heads,’ were impenetrable to boarders;
while at the same time, by means of loopholes and quick-firing
pieces in-board, they could enfilade the waist with musketry
and murdering shot. Thus a ship of the English pattern, at
any rate, could rarely be held even if boarders entered, until
her ‘cage works’ or protected castles were destroyed by gunfire.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
The ship itself, being deep-waisted and built with an
exaggerated sheer upwards toward bow and stem, had no
continuous deck: the decks were laid on various levels, rising
from the waist by steps to the two citadels, an arrangement
which did not contribute, as a flush-deck would have done,
to the longitudinal strength of the vessel, and which was found
inconvenient for the working and transport of ordnance of the
heavier sort.</p>

<p>King Henry VIII, in his efforts to possess fighting ships
superior to those of Spain, France and Scotland, raised not
only artillery but ships themselves to a different rôle. As
he personally urged the manufacture of ordnance in this
country by the subsidizing of foreign talent, so he sought to
improve the design of his ships by inviting Italian shipwrights
to come to England and apply their knowledge to the royal
vessels. Dockyards were founded at Woolwich, Deptford, and
Portsmouth. Large ships were laid down, several were rebuilt,
with many improvements embodied in them: chief of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
being a new artillery armament. The king had seized the
advantages of the sailing ship with broadside fire. “The
development of broadside fire,” says Sir Julian Corbett, “was
a question of gunnery, of naval architecture, and of seamanship.
With Henry’s introduction of heavy guns on board his
larger vessels, however, the true note had been struck, and by
the end of his reign the first two arts had made great strides.
Guns of all patterns and sizes were being cast in England, both
in bronze and iron, which were little inferior to those Nelson
fought with.” The result of the king’s efforts was seen in the
ships laid down in the last years of his reign. The frontispiece
of Mr. Oppenheim’s <cite>History of the Administration of the Royal
Navy</cite> is a picture of one of these, the <i>Tiger</i>, a four-masted
flush-decked vessel, with no sheer, little top hamper, a long
tier of ordnance on the gun deck, and with a beak-head ending
in a spur: one of a class “which shows a very great advance
on anything before afloat and indicates a steady progression
towards the modern type.”</p>

<p>In short, a reversion to a smaller and seaworthier type took
place. The large, unstable and unwieldy “great ship,” such
as the <i>Henry Grace á Dieu</i>, built on the Spanish model, with
lofty ends overweighted with small ordnance, was not effective.
A new invention, attributed to Descharges of Brest in 1501,
viz. the adaptation of portholes to ordnance along the sides
of a ship, perhaps suggested a better form. As the century
advanced, as new and far-distant countries appeared on the
map, the arts of seamanship and gunnery continuously improved;
naval architecture made a corresponding progress.
For sea fighting the high-charged and imposing “great ship”
gave place to a more perfected type—the galleon. “It was
the development of the galleon,” insists the historian, “which
changed the naval art from its medieval to its modern state.”
The galley, eminently suited to the Mediterranean, where
winds were light and slave labour abundant, was found to be
increasingly unsuitable for Atlantic warfare; the galley was
in danger of being rammed, in any wind, by a strong, quick-turning
sailing ship, and suffered from having nearly all its
artillery in the bows; moreover, “the galley service was
always repugnant to our national temperament.” The
galleasse, the hybrid between the oar-driven galley and the
sailing ship, suffered from all the disadvantages of the compromise.
The great ship had now proved to be cumbrous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
and expensive, crank and unseaworthy, leewardly and unmanageable
in even a moderate breeze.</p>

<p>The galleon therefore became the type favoured by the
English navy. Whereas the merchant ship was short in proportion
to its beam, the galleon was built long, with a length
equal to three times its breadth. It had also a long flat floor
like a galley, and was of lower freeboard than a round-ship.
“It was also like a galley flush-decked, and would seem
always to have had the half-deck carried across the waist so
as to make one flush-deck with the old forecastle. In the
larger types the quarter-deck was also carried flush from
stem to stem, so that latterly at any rate a true galleon had
at least two decks and sometimes three. On the upper deck
in the earlier types were erected both fore and aft high-castles
as in a galleasse, but usually on curved lines, which gave the hull
of the old-fashioned galleons the appearance of a half moon.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
The depth of hold at the waist was only about two-fifths
the beam. Its artillery was light but effective, being composed
of light muzzle loaders, a mean between the man-killers and
the heavy bombards of an earlier day. Its masts and spars
were made heavy and large sail area was given it, for speed
and quick manœuvring were the essential qualities which it
was hoped to oppose to the lumbering, high-charged ships of
Spain. Victory was to be sought by a skilful combination of
seamanship and gunnery, rapid fire being poured into an
enemy at a convenient range and bearing. “Plenty of room
and a stand-off fight” sufficiently defines the sea tactics of the
new era.</p>

<p>Throughout the reign of Elizabeth the galleon still remained
the favourite type, though opinion differed, and continued to
differ through the two following centuries, as to the degree to
which it was desirable to “build lofty.” The Hawkins family
of Plymouth shipowners carried a great influence in the
councils of the navy. Sir John Hawkins, whose experience
of shipbuilding and seamanship rendered him a man of importance,
was the author of improvements in this respect, as
in so many others; “the first Elizabethan men-of-war, the
fastest sailers and best sea-boats then afloat, were built to his
plans; and from the time of his appointment as Treasurer of
the Navy dates the change to the relatively low and long type
that made the English ships so much more handy than their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
Spanish antagonists.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> His kinsman, Sir Richard, on the
other hand, preferred large and high-charged ships, “not only
for their moral effect on the enemy, but for their superiority
in boarding and the heavier ordnance and larger crews
they would carry. Two decks and a half he considers to be
the least a great ship should have, and was of opinion that the
fashion for galleasse-built ships—or, as he calls them, ‘race’
ships—in preference to those ‘lofty-built’ had been pushed
too far.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> Ships with large cage-works had an advantage,
he maintained, in affording cover for the crew and positions
for quick-firing batteries; his opponents argued that the
weight of top-hamper saved by their abolition could be put
with better advantage into a heavy artillery.</p>

<p>The advocates of the fast, low-lying ships carried the day.
War came with Spain, and there was soon work to show what
the English ships could do. The <cite>Armada Papers</cite><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> light up
for us, by the fitful glare of the cressets of Hawkins and Co.,
the preparation of the fleet at Plymouth, and show us what
state of efficiency the royal ships were in. “The <i>Hope</i> and
<i>Nonpariel</i> are both graved, tallowed, and this tide into the
road again,” writes William Hawkins to his brother. “We
trim one side of every ship by night and the other side by
day, so that we end the three great-ships in three days this
spring. The ships sit aground so strongly, and are so staunch
as if they were made of a whole tree. The doing of it is very
chargeable, for that it is done by torchlight and cressets, and
in an extreme gale of wind, which consumes pitch, tallow, and
firs abundantly.” Not only the few royal ships, but the whole
of the force which lies in the Sound is tuned for the fight.
“For Mr. Hawkins’ bargain,” writes the Commander-in-Chief
to Lord Burghley, “this much I will say: I have been aboard
of every ship that goeth out with me, and in every place where
any may creep, and there is never a one of them that knows
what a leak means. I do thank God that they be in the estate
they be in.” The Spanish ships prove to be in a very different
condition. High-charged and leewardly, poorly rigged and
lightly gunned, they are so hammered and raked by Lord
Howard’s well-found fleet that, when bad weather ultimately
comes, they are in no condition to combat the elements.
With masts and rigging shattered, water-casks smashed, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
anchors; short-handed and leaking like sieves, they are
hounded northwards to a disaster unparalleled in naval history.</p>

<p>And now, before tracing its evolution through the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, let us glance at the warship
as it existed at the end of the Elizabethan era, and note its
chief constructive features.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>Athwart a keel of large squared timbers, scarphed together
and forming with a massive inner keelson the principal member
or backbone, were laid the curved frames or ribs which, bolted
to each other and to the keel with iron bolts washered and
clinched, gave to the hull its transverse strength and form.
These frames were held together, as they curved upward from
the ground or floor level, by thick longitudinal wales, worked
externally along the frames at convenient heights, and curved
so as to suit the degree of sheer desired.</p>

<p>At the fore end the wales and frames converged to the
centre-line and the keel was prolonged upward to meet
them in a curve or compassing timber, forming the bow or
stem: to the beauty and shapeliness of which, with its projecting
beak-head, the builder devoted much of his attention
and skill. At the other end the frames and wales converged
to a square and lofty stern. The stern post was a massive
timber fastened to the keel and sloping somewhat aft from the
vertical, and from it rose two fashion-pieces “like a pair of
great horns,” which formed, with the horizontal arch and
transom timbers, the framework of the stern. When the
frames had been built up to the requisite height the upper
ends of each opposite pair were joined across by horizontal
beams, which were secured to them by means of brackets or
knees; such beams were worked at the level of the main and
other decks, and served to support them when laid. Joined
by its beams, each pair of frames thus formed a closed structure:
a combination of members which was to resist crushing
and deformation, the blows of the sea, the stresses of gunfire,
the forces due to the weight of the guns and the vessel itself,
and especially the forces thrown on it when the vessel was
aground or on a careen. The rigidity of this combination was
enhanced by the fitting of pillars which were placed vertically
over the keelson to support each beam at its middle. And
sometimes the lower pillars were supplemented by sloping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
struts, worked from the curve of the frames up to the middle
of each beam above.</p>

<p>The skeleton of a ship thus formed, built with well-seasoned
timber, was left standing on the stocks “in frame” for a considerable
period, sometimes for years, exposed to the open
weather. On it eventually a skin of planks was fastened,
secured by wood trenails split and expanded by soft-wood
wedges, both internally and externally; and inside the ship,
to reinforce the frames and in line with them, timbers known
as “riders” were worked. On the beams the decks were
laid: the orlop below the water-line level, and above it, at
a height suitable for the ordnance, the main or gun deck;
above that the upper deck, on the ends of which were reared
the poop (sometimes a half-deck, extending from the stern to
the mainmast, sometimes on that a quarter-deck, over the
steerage) and the forecastle.</p>

<p>Such, very briefly, was the mode of ship construction. The
resulting structure, when caulked and swelled by sea-water,
presented a water-tight and serviceable vessel. Timber provided,
for ships up to a certain size, a suitable material. It
afforded strength and buoyancy, and elasticity sufficient to
obviate local strains and to spread the stresses due to lading,
grounding, careening, or the actions of the wind and sea. The
different parts of the ship’s frame gave mutual support, and
the pressure of the fluid on the exterior of the hull tended, by
constraining the component parts, to preserve the vessel.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>But the timber-built ship possessed an inherent weakness.
Metal plates or girders can be bolted or riveted together so
efficiently as to leave the joints between them almost as strong
as the sections of the plates or girders themselves. Not so wood
beams. However skilfully they might be joined, their joints
were necessarily weaker than all other sections: “it was then,
and still is, impracticable to develop the full strength in end
connections between wooden members.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> The softness of
the wood was an additional source of weakness. Two beams
fastened together by iron bolts might form initially a close
and rigid joint; but if, under the action of alternating or
racking stresses, they became loosened even in a minute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
degree, the tendency to become still looser increased: the
wood gradually yielded under the bolt washers, the bolts no
longer held rigidly, “the very fact that wood and iron were
dissimilar materials tended to hasten the disintegration of
the structure.” With planking a similar effect obtained.
Trenails, expanded by wedges and planed off flush with the
planks which they held together, had only shearing strength;
if once they were loosened they had little power to prevent
the planks from opening further. These weaknesses were
recognised. To minimize their effects the butts of frames,
decks, and side planking, were arranged so that no two neighbouring
butts lay in the same line. But in spite of the most
painstaking craftsmanship, the size of the wooden ship was
limited by its inability to withstand a high degree of stress.
As sizes increased extraordinary endeavours were made to
meet the hogging and sagging strains, to prevent cambering
of the hull, and to stiffen it longitudinally and circumferentially.
Enormous masses of timber were worked into the
internal structure in the form of riders, pillars, standards, and
shores, “the whole of which had an appearance of great
strength, but which in fact, from its weight and injudicious
combinations, was useless, if not injurious.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> Which did, in
fact, clog the ship and usurp the space required for stowage.</p>

<p>As for the masts, experience fixed their number, size and
position. In the earlier ships, as we have seen, four and sometimes
five masts were fitted, after the Mediterranean style.
But later this number was reduced to three. Of these the
foremast was the most important, and it was stepped directly
over the fore-foot of the vessel, the main and mizzen being
pitched to suit. Their height varied with the service and type
of ship. Taunt masts, like those carried by the Flemish ships,
were best for sailing on a wind, for with them narrow sails
could be used which could be set at a sharp angle with the
keel; but short masts and broad yards were favoured by
English mariners, as bringing less strain on a vessel’s sides
and rigging and as being less likely to produce a state of
dangerous instability. The masts were short, very thick, and
heavily shrouded; the standing rigging was led to channels
and deadeyes on the outside of the bulwarks. The bowsprits
were large and “steved” upward at a large angle with the
horizontal; spritsails and spritsail topsails were set on them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
of use mainly when sailing before a wind, yet retaining their
place in our navy till, half-way through the eighteenth century,
the introduction of the fore-and-aft jib brought about an
improvement and in so doing affected the whole disposition
of mastage.</p>

<p>One feature of the masting of the old ships is notable: the
manner in which the various masts were raked. In the <cite>Sea-Man’s
Dictionary</cite><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> the <em>trim</em> of a ship was defined as, “the
condition, as to draught, staying of masts, slackness of shrouds,
etc., in which a ship goes best.” For a given set of conditions
there was a certain rake of masts, a certain position of the
centre of wind-pressure against the sails, which, when discovered,
gave to the vessel its finest sailing qualities. The
knowledge of this adjustment constituted no small part of the
great art of seamanship. In the king’s ships a high proficiency
was attained in it; merchantmen sailed under more diverse
conditions and showed, it appears, a lower level of scientific
inquiry. “Next to men of war (whose daily practice it is)
the Scotch men are the best in the world to find out the trym
of a ship, for they will never be quiet, but try her all ways, and
if there be any goodness in her, they can make her go.” Generally,
the effect of raking the masts aft was to make the vessel
fly up into the wind, and vice versa; in ships with high-built
sterns, especially, it was necessary to have the head-sails set
well forward, to keep them out of the wind. To allow the
masts to be raked as desired their heels were pared away, and
wedges of suitable thickness were driven between them and
the “partners.”</p>

<p>Many other factors contributed to affect, in a manner always
subtle and frequently inexplicable, the sailing qualities of a
ship. The form of the body, the position of masts and the
setting up of the rigging, the disposition of weights, the angle
of the yards, the conditions of stability, all had their effect on
the vessel’s motion, and therefore on her speed through the
water. Free water in a ship’s bilge, for example, had an effect
on her degree of stiffness, and from this cause her speed was
not easily predictable. Charnock relates how, in the colonial
wars of the late eighteenth century, an American vessel, the
<i>Hancock</i>, was captured after an unprecedented chase, solely
because her commander, injudiciously supposing that by
lightening his ship he would enhance her swiftness, pumped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
water out of her. It was noticed, again, that in certain circumstances
the speed of a ship increased when the crew
turned into their hammocks.</p>

<p>The lines of the ship were drawn without reference to any
science of naval architecture, and merely by instinct and the
accumulated experience of the builder; the laws of stability
and of fluid resistance were at this time unknown. Experience
indicated the desirability of a short keel, to make the ship
turn quickly; of an ample rake forward from keel to beak-head—“more
than a third the length of the keel, commonly,”
says Sir Henry Manwayring, for, “a great rake forward gives
a ship good way and makes her keep a good wind, but if she
have not a full bow it will make her pitch mightily into a
head sea.... The longer a ship’s rake is, the fuller must be
the bow”; of a fine run aft, so as to let the water flow strongly
and swiftly to the rudder and make the ship steer and sail
well; of a narrow rudder, so as not to hold much dead water
when the helm was over,—yet, “if a ship have a fat quarter,
she will require a broad rudder.” The correct formation of
the bow was recognised as of the greatest importance, and
the most difficult compromise in the design of a ship. A bow
too bluff offered much resistance to motion through the
water; on the other hand, too sharp a bow lacked buoyancy,
and, from the great weight of mastage, headsails, anchors, etc.,
which it had to support, caused a vessel to pitch badly in a
head sea. “If the bow be too broad,” wrote Captain John
Smith, in his <cite>Sea Man’s Grammar</cite>, “she will seldom carry a
bone in her mouth, or cut a feather, that is, to make a foam
before her: where a well-bowed ship so swiftly presseth the
water as that it foameth, and in the dark night sparkleth like
fire.”</p>

<p>Generally, a vessel built with fine lines lacked end support,
and tended to become arched or camber-keeled, while its
stowage capacity was inconveniently small. The ship’s sides
were made with a considerable degree of tumble-home above
the water-line; though this, again, was a point of compromise
and much argument. For while a reduced breadth of deck
tended to give the hull more girder strength and to diminish
the racking effect on it of heavy ordnance, yet this feature at
the same time, by reducing the angle at which the shrouds
could be set, augmented the stresses which were thrown on
shrouds and bulwarks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>With the seventeenth century a new age of scientific speculation
opened, and, under the personal encouragement of the
Stuart kings, the art and mystery of shipbuilding received an
illumination which was of great value to the royal armaments.</p>

<p>The early interest of James I in his navy is signalized by his
grant of a charter to the corporation of shipwrights: a corporation
whose short-lived story is told by the editor of <cite>The Autobiography
of Phineas Pett</cite>, recently published.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Before the
sixteenth century, he tells us, no special trade was recognized
for the building of warships, as distinct from traders. But in
the early Tudor days, when, owing to the introduction of the
new artillery the war vessel began to diverge in general design
from the merchant ship, certain master shipwrights had been
subsidized by the king for the building and repair of the royal
vessels. The position of these officials was one of importance,
their duties and privileges were extensive. The office was often
hereditary. Thus, the royal patent granted to one James
Baker in 1538 descended, with the accumulated lore and
secrets of his profession, to his son Mathew Baker in 1572. And
that granted to Peter Pett in 1558 descended to Joseph Pett
in 1590. But as shipping grew and shipbuilding became more
complex and widely distributed, the need for some central
authority, which could regulate practice and standardize procedure,
became increasingly felt. Accordingly a petition was
presented. In 1605 the king granted a charter incorporating
the master shipwrights of England as one body corporate and
politic, for the good regulation of shipbuilding of all descriptions.
In 1612 another charter was sealed, giving increased
power to the confraternity: with instruction that it was to
examine each new ship to see that it was properly built,
“with two orlops at convenient distances, strong to carry
ordnance aloft and alow, with her forecastle and half-deck
close for fight.” Shipwrights’ Hall, as the corporation was
called, surveyed and reported on tonnage and workmanship,
and gave advice, when sought, to the lord high admiral. In
the course of time its prestige declined. With the Commonwealth
it grew into disuse, and by 1690 it was altogether
extinct. For nearly a century the guild had struggled in vain
to fulfil the intentions of its founders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
The most distinguished of the master shipwrights of this
period was Phineas Pett, sometime master of arts at Emmanuel
College, Cambridge, who in 1612 succeeded old Mathew Baker
as Master of the guild. Pett, who to a practical knowledge of
design and construction added considerable sea experience,
rose far above his contemporaries, most of whom were little
more than mere carpenters, ignorant of many of the principles
which are now accepted as governing ship design, and themselves
governed almost entirely by tradition and blind precedent.
Science was still in its veriest infancy. The progress
of ship design was still by the tentative and costly method of
full-scale experience; not till the beginning of the nineteenth
century, when new forces and materials had been discovered
which in the end spelt the decline and supersession of the
sailing ship, did science sufficiently direct the lines on which
large sailing ships should be built.</p>

<p>By his bold deviation from established usage, says Fincham,
Mr. Pett established his fame and advanced the interest and
power of the British navy. Before reviewing his handiwork,
however, it will be convenient to note the main directions in
which improvement was at this period sought.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Manwayring, an acquaintance for whom Pett
designed and built a pinnace in the year 1616, wrote at this
time <cite>The Sea-Man’s Dictionary</cite>. In the early years of the
century were also written two treatises which, though not
printed till a later date, had great effect in creating an interest
in naval matters: Sir Walter Raleigh’s <cite>Observations on the
Navy</cite> and <cite>Invention of Shipping</cite>. In the former paper Sir
Walter laid down the six requisites of a good ship: viz. that
she should be strongly built, swift, stout-sided, carry out her
guns in all weathers, lie-to in a gale easily, and stay well. For
the attainment of these qualities he specified certain structural
features: a long run forward, to make her sail well; a long
bearing floor and a “tumble home” above water from the
lower edge of the ports, for stoutness and for stiffness sufficient
to enable her to carry her lower ordnance (which must lie
four feet clear above water) in all weathers. “It is a special
observation,” he wrote, “that all ships sharp before, that
want a long floor, will fall roughly into the sea and take in
water over head and ears. So will all narrow quartered ships
sink after the tail. The high charging of ships it is that brings
them all ill qualities.” In the latter paper he recapitulated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
the various improvements in material of which he had himself
been witness; from which for its interest we quote the following
extract. “The striking of the topmast (a wonderful great
ease to great ships both at sea and in harbour) hath been
devised, together with the chain pump ... the bonnet and
the drabler. We have fallen into consideration of the length
of cables, and by it we resist the malice of the greatest winds
that can blow, witness our small Milbrook men of Cornwall,
that ride it out at anchor, half seas over between England and
Ireland, all the winter quarter.... For true it is, that the
length of the cable is the life of the ship in all extremities.
We carry our ordnance better than we were wont, because
our nether overloops are raised commonly from the water, to
wit, between the lower part of the port and the sea. We have
also raised our second decks and given more vent thereby to
our ordnance, tying on our nether overloop. We have added
cross pillars in our royal ships to strengthen them, which be
fastened from the kelson to the beams of the second deck. We
have given longer floors to our ships than in elder times, and
better bearing under water, whereby they never fall into the
sea after the head and shake the whole body, nor sink stern,
nor stoop upon a wind, by which the breaking loose of our
ordnance or the not use of them, with many other discommodities
are avoided.... And to say the truth a miserable
shame and dishonour it were for our shipwrights, if they did
not exceed all other in the setting up of our royal ships, the
errors of other nations being far more excusable than ours.”
Sir Walter was inaccurate in attributing all the improvements
enumerated to his own generation; bonnets, for instance, were
in use long before his day. Nevertheless his paper constitutes
one of the most important contributions to the history of naval
architecture in this country.</p>

<p>In the early years of the century, too, evidence as to the
shortcomings of contemporary naval construction was
furnished by a fierce critic, Captain Waymouth. He proclaimed
that English shipwrights built only by uncertain
traditional precepts and observations; that none of them
could build two ships alike or predict with accuracy their
draught of water; that all their ships were crank, leewardly—“a
great disadvantage in a fight”—difficult to steer and sail,
too deep in the water, of less capacity than the Hollanders, and
so badly built and designed as frequently to require “furring,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
or reinforcing by extra planking. He advocated building ships
longer, broader, with longer floors so as to reduce their draught,
and snugger in respect of upper works. And though he failed
on trial to translate his ideas into successful performance, his
criticisms are accepted by historians as being probably well-founded.</p>

<p>The opinions expressed by the above writers<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> indicate for us
in general terms the chief particulars in which the ships of this
period fell short of naval requirements. They were designed
without knowledge of the laws governing the strength of
materials, stability, and the motion of bodies through water;
they were built without adequate supervision, frequently of
green timber badly scarphed or cut across the grain, and were
overburdened with ordnance. Their holds were cumbered with
large quantities of shingle ballast which tended to clog the
limber-holes of the bilge and rot the frames and floor timbers;
while the stowage space amidships was further usurped by the
cook-rooms, which were placed on the shingle, and which, by
the heat radiated from their brick sides, did damage to the
timbers and seams in their vicinity. Vessels were rarely
sheathed. Though John Hawkins had devised a system of
sheathing by a veneer of planking nailed over a layer of hair
and tar, it was only to ships going on special service in seas
where the worm was active that sheathing was applied.
Sheathing possessed, then, some significance. In 1620, for
instance, the Venetian ambassador reported to his government
the discovery that some of our ships were being sheathed,
and from this fact deduced an impending expedition to the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p>With the navy in the depths of neglect and with shipbuilding
in the state described, Phineas Pett began to impose his
permanent mark on design and construction. The mechanism
by which he secured his results, the calculations and methods
and rules used by him, were veiled in profound secrecy, in
accordance with the traditions of his profession. He began by
new-building old ships of the Elizabethan time, giving them
an improved form so far as practicable. His friend and patron
was the young Prince Henry, for whom in 1607 he made a
model which the king greatly admired. And shortly after this,
in the face of much jealousy on the part of his rivals, he laid down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
by command a new great ship—the <i>Prince Royal</i>, of 1187 tons,
with a breadth of 43 feet and a keel length of 115 feet, double-built
and sumptuously adorned, in all respects the finest ship
that had ever been built in England. She carried no less than
fifty-five guns, her general proportions were of a unity, and
her strength was of a superiority, far in advance of current
practice. In strength especially she marked an advance which
yielded benefit later, in the wars with Holland. She was double
planked, “a charge which was not formerly thought upon, and
all the butt-heads were double-bolted with iron bolts.”</p>

<p>But how difficult a matter it was for a builder to depart from
tradition, is shown from Pett’s account of the inquisition to
which he was subjected in connection with the building of this
famous ship. His rivals took advantage of the “Commission
of Enquiry into the abuses of the navy,” of 1608, to indict
him for bad design, bad building, and peculation. So much
hard swearing took place on both sides that at last King James
himself decided to act as judge, and at Woolwich, with the
wretched Phineas on his knees before him, opened his court of
inquiry. “Much time,” says the diarist, “was spent in
dispute of proportions, comparing my present frame with
former precedents and dimensions of the best ships, for length,
breadth, depth, floor, and other circumstances. One point of
proportion was mainly insisted upon and with much violence
and eagerness urged on both sides, which was the square of the
ship’s flat in the midships, they affirming constantly upon their
oath it was full thirteen feet, we as constantly insisting that it
was but eleven foot eight inches.” In the end the king called
in a mathematician and had the controversy settled by actual
measurement. None of the charges brought against him being
sustained, Phineas was acquitted and restored once more to
royal favour, to his own delight and to that of his youthful
patron, Prince Henry.</p>

<p>The <i>Prince Royal</i> marks a new epoch in ship design. She
was such a departure from all previous forms that she made the
fame of Phineas Pett secure. She became, indeed, the parent
or type of all future warships down to the beginning of the
nineteenth century; for (says Charnock), were the profuse
ornaments removed, her contour, or general appearance, would
not so materially differ from that of the modern vessel of the
same size as to render her an uncommon sight, or a ship in
which mariners would hesitate to take the sea. In her a final<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
departure was made from the archaic form imposed on fighting
ships by tradition. The picture Charnock gives of her is of a
highly ornamented but low and flush-decked vessel armed to
the ends with two tiers of heavy guns. The projecting beak-head,
a relic from the galley days which had been so prominent
a feature of Tudor construction, has almost disappeared: the
bow curves gracefully upward to a lion close under the bowsprit.
The wales have little sheer; the stern is compact and
well supported, with beautiful lines. The quarter galleries are
long, and are incorporated in the structure in a curious manner:
in the form of indented, tower-like projections, with ornamented
interspaces. The whole picture gives evidence of stout
scantlings and invaluable solidity. Although in many respects
the <i>Prince Royal</i> was a masterpiece she was primitive in the
variety of her armament. On the lower deck she carried two
cannon-petro, six demi-cannon, twelve culverins; on her upper
deck eighteen demi-culverins; and on quarter-deck and poop
a number of sakers and port-pieces. Also, unfortunately, she
was built of green timber, so her life was short.</p>

<p>In building a ship of unprecedented burthen Pett had the
support of a large public opinion. The advantages attaching
to large size were by this time generally appreciated: in the
case of fighting ships, in respect of strength, artillery force, and
sea endurance, in the case of merchant ships, in respect of
carrying capacity and economy of crew. The growth in the
size of merchant shipping during the reign was indeed remarkable.
Trade followed the flag, and the Jacobean merchant
made haste to profit by the conquests of the Elizabethan
adventurer. For a short while after the war with Spain our
mercantile marine was stagnant; at the accession of James I
only small vessels of less than a hundred tons were being built,
and English merchants were having strange recourse to the
hiring of foreigners. But this state of things did not last for
long. The story of the success of the Earl of Cumberland and
his 800-ton <i>Scourge of Malice</i>, and the sight of the great Portuguese
carrack captured in 1592, are said to have stimulated the
merchants of London to possess themselves of vessels fit for the
Eastern trade. It is said, again, that the appearance of two
large Dutch ships in the Thames supplied the sudden impulse
to build big. Be that as it may, “the idea spread like wild-fire.”
Larger ships were laid down, and by the end of the
reign the country possessed a considerable fleet of ships of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
500 tons and above. In one instance, at least, the pendulum
swung too far, and experience soon exposed the disadvantages
of excessive dimensions: the reduction in strength, the
unhandiness in shallow waters, the almost impossibility of
graving and breaming, the risking in a single bottom of too
great a venture. The <i>Trades Increase</i>, built for the new East
India Company in 1605 by William Burrell and launched by
the king at Deptford, was of no less than 1,100 tons burthen.
On her first voyage to Java she was lost by fire, and no more
ships of her size were ordered by the Company.</p>

<p>With the expansion of merchant shipping and with the
recognition of artillery as the main instrument of naval warfare
fighting ships made a corresponding advance in size. The
Commission of Reform of 1618, on whose report the subsequent
reorganization of the Navy was based, held that the primacy
of the big gun had at last been established. “Experience
teacheth,” the Commissioners recorded, “how sea-fights in
these days come seldom to boarding, or to great execution of
bows, arrows, small shot and the sword, but are chiefly performed
by the great artillery breaking down masts, yards,
tearing, raking, and bilging the ships, wherein the great
advantage of His Majesty’s navy must carefully be maintained
by appointing such a proportion of ordnance to each ship as
the vessel will bear.” They recognized the extravagance of
small ships, and advised that in future the royal navy should
consist of a nucleus of about thirty large ships, which with the
merchant fleet should form one complete service; royal ships
of over 800 tons; great ships of over 600 tons; middling ships
of about 450 tons. They also formulated the chief requirements
of naval construction in considerable detail. This pontifical
pronouncement on ship dimensions was doubtless of value in
connection with the contemporary project to which their work
had reference; nevertheless it formed a dangerous precedent
for future administrations. It shackled the genius of the shipbuilder.
It degraded design. The ship, especially the timber-built
sailing warship, was essentially a compromise between a
number of conflicting elements. To obtain full value from his
skill the designer required as free as possible a choice of means
to his end; and any over-drawing of the specification, or
surplusage of data beyond the barest requirements, tended to
tie his hands and render impossible a satisfactory design. It
was this over-specifying of dimensions in the interests of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
standardization which, as we shall presently see, stultified
shipbuilding in England not only in the seventeenth but
throughout the whole of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>But the report of 1618 was doubtless of great value as a
guidance for the building of the new Stuart navy. “The
manner of building, which in ships of war is of greatest importance,
because therein consists both their sailing and force. The
ships that can sail best can take or leave (as they say), and use
all advantages the winds and seas afford; and their mould, in
the judgment of men of best skill, both dead and alive, should
have the length treble the breadth, and the breadth in like
proportion to the depth, but not to draw above 16 foot of
water because deeper ships are seldom good sailers.... They
must be somewhat snug built, without double galleries and too
lofty upper works, which overcharge many ships and make
them loom fair, but not work well at sea.” As for the
strengthening of the royal ships the Commissioners subscribed
to the manner of building approved by “our late worthy
prince”: “first, in making three orlops, whereof the lowest
being two feet under water, both strengtheneth the ship, and
though her sides be shot through, keepeth it from bilging by
shot and giveth easier means to find and stop the leaks.
Second, in carrying their orlops whole floored throughout from
end to end. Third, in laying the second orlop at such convenient
height that the ports may bear out the whole fire of
ordnance in all seas and weathers. Fourth, in placing the cook-rooms
in the forecastle, as other ships of war do, because being
in the midships, and in the hold, the smoke and heat so search
every corner and seam, that they make the oakum spew out,
and the ships leaky, and some decay; besides, the best room
for stowage of victualling is thereby so taken up, that transporters
must be hired for every voyage of any time; and,
which is worst, when all the weight must be cast before and
abaft, and the ships are left empty and light in the midst, it
makes them apt to sway in the back, as the <i>Guardland</i> and
divers others have done.”</p>

<p>The ships built under the regulations of the Commissioners
were certainly an improvement on earlier ships in many
respects, but in one element of power they proved to be
deficient, namely, in speed. The stoutly built, full-bodied,
lumbering English two-deckers were out-sailed and out-manœuvred,
it was noticed, by the relatively light and fine-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>lined
Hollanders. Moreover our smaller ships were known to
be no match in speed for the Dunkirk privateers which at this
time infested the seas. A new type was seen to be necessary.
The existing differentiation of warships into rates or classes
was insufficient. For the line of battle there must be ships in
which force of artillery was the predominant quality; but for
other duties there must also be ships in which speed, and not
force, was the distinguishing note. From this necessity was
evolved the <em>frigate</em>.</p>

<p>Soon after the accession of Charles I an attempt was made to
establish the new type by building small vessels on the model of
the largest, miniatures which it was hoped would prove good
sailors and capable, although square-sailed, of sailing near a
wind. The Ten Whelps were laid down: flush-decked three-masted
vessels of 200 tons, 62 feet long on the keel and 25
feet in breadth. They were not a success. It was left for
Dunkirk, “the smartest dockyard in Europe,” to found the
new model. In imitation of a captured Dunkirk privateer our
first frigate was built in 1646 by Peter, son of Phineas Pett,
and her success was such that he had the achievement recorded
on his tomb. The <i>Constant Warwick</i> was 85 feet in keel-length,
26 feet 5 inches in breadth, of 315 tons burden and 32 guns.
She was “an incomparable sailer.” Before the first Dutch war
was over she had taken as much money from privateers as
would have completely laden her.</p>

<p>It seems probable that the prestige of his name was sufficient
to give Peter Pett a freedom from interference in his design
which was not accorded less distinguished shipbuilders. In
’45 Andrews Burrell, in a remonstance addressed to Parliament,
protested, “For the love of heaven let not the shipwrights
that are to build them [three frigates for special service] be
misled by those that would, but cannot, direct them, which
error hath been very hurtful to the navy heretofore.” By the
interference of Sir John Pennington, he asserted, the builders
of the Ten Whelps were so misled that they proved sluggish and
unserviceable. “Let no rules be given the shipwrights more
than their tonnage, with the number and weight of their
ordnance, and that the number and weight of their ordnance
may be suitable to the burden of each frigate.”</p>

<p>King Charles, whose personal interest in the royal navy
equalled that of his father, favoured the tendency to enlarge
the tonnage and the individual power of his fighting ships.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
The <i>Prince Royal</i> displayed the advantages of size. The
Dutch people, jealous of the interference with their eastern
trade, were known to be building large ships. Across the
channel an ambitious and all-powerful minister was envisaging
the possession of a navy in which an inferiority in numbers
might be neutralized by the superiority of the unit. In France
a vessel of 1400 tons had been laid down. Charles determined
to take up the challenge, obtaining the money by hook or by
crook wherewith to build a greater. In the year 1634 the
decision was made. A model of a great three-decker mounting
a hundred and four guns was presented to him by Phineas
Pett, and shortly afterwards the master of the shipwrights
received the royal command to build a ship, and to proceed in
person to the forests of Durham to select the thickstuff, knee
timber, and planking requisite for the task.</p>

<p>Opposition to the building of such a prodigious vessel
appeared from different quarters. Great ships, in the opinion
of Sir Walter Raleigh, were “of marvellous charge and fearful
cumber.” The cost of so large a ship must needs be great, for
not only the whole cost, but the cost per ton, increased with
the size of the vessel; so wasteful a process was the building of
a great ship, indeed, that it was not unusual to build a small
ship simultaneously, out of the timber discarded: a practice
known as “building a small ship out of a great one’s chips.”
Ships of the greatest size, again, were “of little service, less
nimble, less mainable, and very seldom employed.” Nor was
it believed that so large a vessel as that projected could be
built. Trinity House, when they heard of the design, uttered
a formal protest. Such a ship, they argued, would be too big
for service, and unsafe from her enormous size. To carry such
a number of pieces she must be a three-decker, and to build a
serviceable three-decker was beyond the art or wit of man; if
the lower tier were too low they would be useless in a sea, if at
5 or 5½ feet above the water-line then the third tier would be
so high as to endanger the ship. In spite of this protest the
new ship was laid down, and nearly two years later, in the
autumn of ’37, she was launched at Woolwich, “the pride and
glory of the Caroline navy.”</p>

<p>The <i>Sovereign of the Seas</i>, the <i>Sovereign</i>, or the <i>Royal
Sovereign</i>, as she was called by successive governments, was
another great advance in size and solidity on all preceding
construction, and was the masterpiece of Phineas Pett. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
length by the keel was 128 feet, her main breadth 48 feet, her
overall length 232 feet. She had three flush decks and a forecastle,
a half-deck, a quarter-deck, and a roundhouse. Her
armament showed an approach to symmetry; the lower tier
consisted of cannon and demi-cannon, the middle tier of
culverins and demi-culverins. In one respect she was less
advanced than Pett’s earlier effort, the <i>Prince Royal</i>, in that
she had an old-fashioned beakhead, low hawses and a low and
exposed forecastle. In general form she was extolled by all, and
bore witness to the genius of her designer. No better form,
said a later critic and constructor<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> after making an analysis
of her lines—no better form could have been devised for a ship
built (according to the prevailing customs of the times) so high
out of water and so overloaded with ornaments. The king
took a personal pride in her, and during her construction visited
Woolwich and “seriously perused all the ship within board.”
For him an elaborate description was written which, quoted at
length by various writers, serves to show the extent to which
mere decoration contributed to the cost of a royal ship. Two
pictures of the vessel are reproduced by Charnock, of such
obvious disparity that they serve to show (as the author
observes) to what a degree artists may differ in the presentment
of the same vessel. They confirm, besides, the profuseness
of the ornamentation which was massed on her—the trophies,
angels, emblems, mouldings—which made her the occasion of
loud complaints against ship-money, and “a miracle of black
and gold.”</p>

<p>The <i>Sovereign of the Seas</i> had a distinguished career. When
cut down a deck she proved to be an exceptionally serviceable
unit, taking part in all the great actions of the Dutch wars and
crowning her work at La Hogue, where she engaged, crippled,
and forced to fly for shallow water the great <i>Soleil Royal</i>, 104,
the French flagship. At length, when laid up at Chatham in
1696 in order to be rebuilt, she was set on fire by negligence and
destroyed.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>By the outbreak of the first Dutch war the modern ideas
introduced by Phineas Pett had received a general embodiment
in the navy. Blake found to his hand ships well suited
to the intended warfare, nor was he much concerned to add
either to their number or their magnitude. Only in one feature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
did the new vessels built show any difference from older construction:
their depth in hold was reduced, probably to render
them more suitable for work among the shallow waters of the
coast of Holland.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> In other important respects improvement
had preceded the opening of hostilities.</p>

<p>The lofty stern with which it had been the custom to endow
the sailing ship was a feature which had survived from ancient
times. In the galley, whose armament was concentrated in the
bows, the after part was not devoted to military fittings, but
was appropriated chiefly to the accommodation of the officers.
So it was in the galleon or sailing ship. With the desire and
need for increased accommodation the extra space was obtained
by prolonging aft the broad horizontal lines of the vessel and
terminating them in a square frame. To give more space,
quarter galleries were then added, outside the vessel. Then
extra tiers of cabins were added, also with quarter galleries,
each storey, as in the case of domestic architecture, projecting
over that beneath it, and the whole forming, with its surmounting
taffrails, lanterns and ornaments, an excessively
weighty and top-heavy structure. Similarly, at the fore end
of the ship there remained the survival of the ancient forecastle.</p>

<p>With the acceptance of artillery as the medium for battle,
with the decay of boarding tactics and the decline in value of
small man-killing firearms, close-fights and end-castles, the
lofty forecastles and sterns ceased to possess much of their
special value. The arguments of Sir Richard Hawkins’ day in
favour of large cage-works no longer held; nor could the
preference of some shipbuilders for high sterns, as allowing a
quick sheer and thereby contributing to the girder strength of
the hull, be considered sufficient to justify their retention. The
stern galleries held a great deal of wind and tended to rot the
decks in their vicinity; their weight put a strain upon the
supporting keel; but, chiefly, the danger of their taking fire in
action induced the authorities to cut them down. For similar
reasons the forecastles were attacked. But there was strong
opposition to their elimination, because of the cover which they
afforded in a fight. In 1652 the <i>Phœnix</i>, one of the finest
frigates in the service, was taken by a Dutch ship, “having no
forecastle for her men to retire to.” In the second Dutch war
experience confirmed their usefulness. “All the world,” wrote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
Mr. Secretary Pepys in his diary for the 4th July, 1666, “now
sees the use of forecastles for the shelter of men.”</p>

<p>No general increase in the size of our ships took place till
toward the end of the third Dutch war. Until that time the
navy of France was a negligible quantity; in 1664, it is said,
the only war-vessel at Brest was one old fireship. The Dutch,
our only strong opponents, fought in ships not unlike our own,
stout, buoyant vessels mounting from 24 to 60 guns, and of
from 300 to 1200 tons burden. Geography had a curious
influence on their construction. Owing to the shallowness of
their coasts the Hollanders built their ships with less draught
and flatter floors than those of other countries; from which
policy they derived advantages of a greater carrying capacity
and, in pursuit, an ability to retreat among the shallows; but
on account of which they suffered a serious handicap in the
hour of action, when, faced by English ships built of superior
material and with finer bottoms which enabled them to hold a
better wind, they were weathered and out-fought.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>There was no apparent advantage, therefore, in augmenting
the size of our ships. Improvement was sought, rather, from a
further unification of the calibres of the guns, and from an
increase in the number carried. Their characteristics of shortness
and large bore were such as to make them well-suited to
the form of battle now favoured by English leaders—the close-quarter
action.</p>

<p>In solidity of construction the English ships compared
favourably with those of the Dutch. The thick scantlings
introduced by Phineas Pett now proved of great value; the
wood itself, tough English oak, was unequalled by any other
timber. English oak was the best, as Fuller noted. Even the
Dutch had built some of their ships of it; while other countries
frequently built of inferior fir, the splinters of which killed more
than were hit by hostile cannon balls. To what was the
superiority of the English timber due? To the soil and climate
of this favoured country. Under the influence of successions of
warmth and cold, of rain and sunshine, frost and wind, all in a
degree most favourable for alternate growth and consolidation,
the English oak attained an unrivalled strength and durability.
Trees planted in forests, where mutual protection was afforded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
from wind and cold, grew rapidly, but were inferior in quality
to trees planted in small parcels or along the hedgerows; these
latter, slow-growing and tough, felled “at the wane of the
moon and in the deep of winter,” supplied the thickstuff, knees,
and planking for generations of our royal ships. Their endurance
was frequently remarkable. The bottom timbers would
last for fifty or sixty years, but the upper works, which were
subject to alternations of heat and cold, dryness and moisture,
decayed in a much shorter space of time. The <i>Royal William</i>
is quoted by Charnock as a case in point. This first rate ship
was launched in the year 1719, and never received any material
repair until 1757. A few years later she was cut down to a
third rate of 80 guns. Participating in all the sea wars of the
time, she was surveyed in 1785 and converted into a guardship,
which post she filled till early in the nineteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>Much attention, as we have noted, was given in this scientifically
minded Stuart age to the form of body best suited to
motion through water, but the efforts to improve design were
largely misdirected. Many of our ships were unsatisfactory,
not only from their slowness but because they were crank or
tender-sided, and unable to bear out their lower guns or even
to carry a stout sail. They were so clogged with timbers
internally that they could not carry the victuals and stores
necessary for long voyages; and vessels built by contract were
often found to be carelessly put together, of green, unseasoned,
and unsuitable timber.</p>

<p>After the Restoration the mantle of the Petts descended on a
master shipwright of Portsmouth, who became an authoritative
exponent of ship design, and to whose ability several improvements
were due. “Another great step and improvement to our
navy,” recorded Mr. Pepys in 1665, “put in practice by Sir
Anthony Deane, was effected in the <i>Warspight</i> and <i>Defiance</i>,
which were to carry six months’ provisions, and their guns four
and a half feet from the water.” In the same diary for 19th
May of the following year occurs the following characteristic
note: “Mr. Deane did discourse about his ship the <i>Rupert</i>,
which succeeds so well, as he has got great honour by it; and
I some, by recommending him. The king, duke, and every
body, say it is the best ship that was ever built. And then he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
fell to explain to me the manner of casting the draught of
water which a ship will draw, beforehand, which is a secret the
king and all admire in him; and he is the first that hath come
to any certainty beforehand of foretelling the draught of water
of a ship, before she is launched.” The calculations used by
Sir Anthony Deane to forecast the draught of a projected ship
might win him applause among the philosophers; but the
scoffer at theory was able to point to considerable achievements
wrought by men who made no pretence of any knowledge of
science. In 1668 the <i>Royal Charles</i>, 110, was launched at
Deptford. “She was built,” wrote Evelyn, “by old Shish, a
plain, honest carpenter, master builder of this dock, but one
who can give little account of his art by discourse, and is hardly
capable of reading.”</p>

<p>The interest of Charles II in naval architecture may be
gathered from a letter written by him in 1673: “I am very
glad that the <i>Charles</i> does so well; a girdling this winter, when
she comes in, will make her the best ship in England: the next
summer, if you try the two sloops that were built at Woolwich
that have my invention in them, they will outsail any of the
French sloops. Sir Samuel Morland has now another fancy
about weighing anchors; and the resident of Venice has made
a model also to the same purpose.”</p>

<p>To girdle a ship, was to fasten planks along her sides some
two or three strakes above and below the water-line; this had
the effect of adding to her beam and thereby rendering her
stiffer under sail. Incessant girdling seems to have been necessary
at this period, to counter the defective conditions in which
English ships were designed, built, and sent to sea. Ships were
consistently restricted in beam, in compliance with the faulty
“establishments,” and under a mistaken notion that narrowness,
in itself, directly contributed to speed. “Length,” says
Charnock, “was the only dimension regarded as indispensably
necessary, by the ancients for their galleys and by the moderns
for galleons. Breadth was not considered, or if considered was
accepted as a necessary evil.” Pepys remarked, “that the
builders of England, before 1673, had not well considered that
breadth only will make a stiff ship.” It was an inquiry ordered
by Sir Richard Haddock in 1684 which brought to light the
fulness of the fallacy; ships were subsequently made broader,
and experience showed that a good breadth was beneficial, not
only for stability but for speed and sea-keeping qualities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
But even if a ship were built initially broad enough, the
continual addition of armament and top-hamper to which she
was often subjected had the effect eventually of impairing her
stability. In such a case there were two remedies: to ballast
or to girdle. The former expedient was objectionable, as it
involved an increase both of displacement and of draught.
Girdling was therefore generally practised. By this means
the vessel was made stiffer, her buoyancy was improved, and
her sides were also rendered less penetrable between wind and
water. Even if, when thus girdled, she proved to be less stiff
than the enemy this was not altogether a disadvantage: she
formed a steadier gun-platform, her sides were less strained by
the sea and, because her rolling was less violent, her topmasts
were less liable to be sprung. But sufficient stiffness was
necessary to allow of her lowest and heaviest tier of guns being
fought in moderate weather; and for this reason alone, girdling
was preferable to ballasting, in that the former tended to keep
the guns high out of water while the latter brought them nearer
the water-line.</p>

<p>Although rigidly restricted in dimensions, ships put to sea in
these days under such varying conditions that it was difficult
indeed to foretell whether a vessel were seaworthy or not.
A commissioner of James the Second’s reign complained bitterly
of the injudicious management whereby “many a fast sailing
ship have come to lose that property, by being over-masted,
over-rigged, over-gunned (as the <i>Constant Warwick</i>, from
26 guns and an incomparable sailer, to 46 guns and a slug),
over-manned (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vide</i> all the old ships built in the parliament time
now left), over-built (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vide</i> the <i>Ruby</i> and <i>Assurance</i>), and having
great taffrails and galleries, etc., to the making many formerly a
stiff, now a tender-sided ship, bringing thereby their head and
tuck to lie too low in the water.”</p>

<p>In spite of these strictures it must be remembered that our
ships had qualities which, brought into action by brave crews
and resolute leaders, served the nation well in the day of battle.
In no naval war, perhaps, did superiority of material exert
such a consistent and preponderating effect as in the seventeenth
century wars between this country and Holland.</p>

<p>The tactics of the English leaders involved close-quarter
fighting. The material, both guns and ships, certainly favoured
these tactics; though to what extent tactics dictated the form
of the material, or material reacted on tactics, it may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
difficult to decide. In one respect tactics undoubtedly directed
the evolution of the material: while the Dutch employed a
“gregarious system” of mutual support of their vessels by
others of various force, fighting in groups and throwing in fireships
as opportunity offered, the English always sought to
match individual ships.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Forming in line ahead—a formation,
said to have been first used by Tromp, which enabled our
vessels to avoid the fireships—they came to close quarters in a
series of duels in which the strength and prowess of each
individual ship was its only means of victory. The success of
this plan caused the Dutch to imitate it. The size of their ships
rapidly grew; their weakest units were discarded. Three-deckers
were laid down, at first carrying only 76 guns, but later,
after the peace of 1674, as large as the British first rates. But
by that time the critical battles had been lost and won. And
the success of the British is ascribed, in Derrick’s memoirs,
chiefly to the superior size of our ships, “an advantage which
all the skill of the Dutch could not compensate.”</p>

<p>With the institution of the line of battle a need arose for a
symmetry between ships which had never before existed. From
this arose, not only that more complete differentiation of
force<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> which lasted through the following century, but a still
more stringent ruling of dimensions according to “establishments,”
which ruling, injudiciously applied, was henceforth to
exercise so harmful an effect on English naval construction.</p>

<p>After the peace of 1674 the navy sank into inefficiency. The
French navy, on the other hand, ascended in power with an
extraordinary rapidity. By 1681 it had expanded so much
under the fostering care of M. Colbert that it comprised no
fewer than one hundred and fifteen ships of the line. In design,
as apart from construction, French ships were superior to ours.
In size especially they had an advantage, being universally
larger than British ships of the same artillery force: an
advantage based on the law, known to our own shipbuilders
but never applied, that <em>the greater the dimensions of a ship,
relatively to the weight she has to carry, the better she will sail</em>. So
superior were some French ships which visited Spithead seen
to be, that in imitation of them Sir Anthony Deane was ordered
to design and build the <i>Harwich</i>; and from the plans of this
ship nine others were ordered by parliament, the class constituting
the greatest advance in naval architecture of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
time. But this departure from precedent had little effect. In
dimensions as compared with tonnage we continued parsimonious.
In the face of French experience we cramped our
ships to the requirements of the faulty “establishments”; and
until the end of the century no increase in size took place
except in the case of some ships laid down in the year 1682,
when the threat of a war with Louis XIV not improbably
caused them to be constructed on a more extensive scale than
had ever before been in practice.</p>

<p>In another respect our ships were inferior in design to those
of our chief rivals: in the extreme degree of “tumble home”
given to their sides. Adhering to ancient practice in this particular,
in order to obtain advantages which have already
been mentioned, we suffered increasingly serious disadvantages.
The sides of our ships were so convex that, when sailing
on a wind, every wave was guided upward to the upper deck,
thereby keeping the crew continually wet. The deck space
required for the efficient working of the sails was contracted.
Moreover, ships having this high degree of convexity were
more easily overset than were wall-sided ships. This exaggerated
convexity had a striking effect on one feature of
our construction, viz. the manner in which we affixed the
chain-plates, to which the shrouds were secured, in a low
position on the curve of the hull; while Holland and France
raised them to a more convenient height—over the upper tier
of guns, in their two-decked ships.</p>

<p>On the other hand the horizontal lines of our ships were (in
the absence of science) cleverly moulded. The after lines in
particular were well suited for supporting the stern and at the
same time allowing a free run of water to the rudder; other
nations, overlooking the importance of this part of the vessel,
adhered to the old-fashioned square tuck and stern which was
a chief but unappreciated factor of the resistance to the passage
of the vessel through water.</p>

<p>When war actually broke out in 1689 the balance of material
between English and French was much the same in character
as it had been between English and Dutch. Our fleet was once
more in a seaworthy and efficient condition. Our guns were
generally shorter and of larger bore than those of the French;
our ships were narrower and less able to bear out their ordnance,
but their sides were thicker, and better able to withstand the
racket of gun fire. Once more, at La Hogue, the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
squadrons showed that they possessed the offensive and
defensive qualities which favoured victory in close-quarter
fighting; and the end of the century found the prestige of the
navy at a level as high as that to which Cromwell and Blake
had brought it.</p>

<p>In the decade which ended in 1689 the navy had passed, on
its administrative side, “from the lowest state of impotence
to the most advanced step towards a lasting and solid prosperity.”
In Pepys’ rare little <cite>Memoirs</cite> the story of this
dramatic change is told. We read how, after five years’
governance by the commission charged by the king with the
whole office of the Lord High Admiral, the navy found itself
rotten to the core; how in ’85 the king resolved to take up
its management again, helped by his royal brother; how he
sent for Mr. Pepys; how at his instigation new, honest, and
energetic Commissioners were appointed, including among
them the reluctant Sir Anthony Deane; how Mr. Pepys
himself strove to reorganize, how new regulations were introduced,
sea stores established, finances checked, malpractices
exposed, the navy restored both in spirit and material.</p>

<p>Mr. Pepys claimed to prove that integrity and general knowledge
were insufficient, if unaccompanied by vigour, assiduity,
affection, strictness of discipline and method, for the successful
conduct of a navy; and that by the strenuous conjunction
of zeal, honesty, good husbandry and method, and not least
by the employment of technical knowledge, the Royal Navy
had been rendered efficient once again.</p>

<p>The following extract from an Essay on the Navy, printed
in 1702, is here quoted for its general significance:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The cannon (nearly 10,000 brass and iron) are for nature
and make according to the former disposition and manner of
our mariners’ fighting (whose custom was to fight board and
board, yard-arm and yard-arm, through and through, as they
termed it, and not at a distance in the line, and a like, which
practice till of late our seniors say they were strangers to), they
are therefore much shorter and of larger bore than the French,
with whom to fight at a distance is very disadvantageous, as
has been observed in several fights of late, their balls or bullets
flying over our ships before ours could reach them by a
mile....” etc., etc.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>In Laputa, early in the eighteenth century, the people were
so engrossed in the mathematics that the constant study of
abstruse problems had a strange and distorting effect on
the whole life of the island. Their houses were built according
to such refined instructions as caused their workmen to
make perpetual mistakes; their clothes were cut (and often
incorrectly) by mathematical calculation; the very viands on
their tables were carved into rhomboids, cycloids, cones,
parallelograms, and other mathematical figures!</p>

<p>To most Englishmen of that time any attempt to apply
science to shipbuilding must have appeared as far-fetched and
grotesque as these practices of the Laputans. Ship design
was still an art, veiled in mystery, its votaries guided only by
blind lore and groping along an increasingly difficult path by
processes of trial and error. The methods of applied science
were as yet unknown. The builder was often a mere carpenter,
ignorant of mathematics and even of the use of simple plans;
the savant in his quiet study and the seaman on the perilous
seas lived in worlds apart from each other and from him, and
could not collaborate. Such speculative principles as the shipbuilder
possessed were almost wholly erroneous; no single
curve or dimension of a ship, it is said, was founded on a
rational principle. Everything was by tradition or authority.
Knowledge had not yet coalesced in books. Men kept such
secrets as they had in manuscript, and their want of knowledge
was covered by silence and mystery. Preposterous theories
were maintained by the most able men and facts were denied
or perverted so as to square with them. “Forgetful of the
road pointed out by Lord Bacon, who opposed a legitimate
induction from well-established facts to hypothesis founded on
specious conjectures, and too hastily giving up as hopeless
the attainment of a theory combining experiment with established
scientific principles, they have contented themselves
with ingeniously inventing <em>mechanical methods</em> of forming the
designs of ships’ bodies of arcs of circles, others of ellipses,
parabolas, catenaries—which they thought to possess some
peculiar virtue and which they investigated with the minutest
mathematical accuracy. So they became possessed of a
System. And, armed with this, they despised all rivals without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
one; and, trusting to it, rejected all the benefits of experiment
and of sea experience.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>The intervention of the philosophers had not had any
appreciable effect. Sir William Petty had indeed projected a
great work on the theory of shipbuilding; he had carried out
model experiments in tanks, and had invented a double-keeled
vessel which, by its performances on passage between Holyhead
and Dublin, had drawn public attention to his theories.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
In his discourse before the Royal Society on Duplicate Proportions,
he had opened out new and complex considerations for
the shipbuilder; inviting him to forsake his golden rule, or
Rule of Three, and apply the law <em>x varies as y²</em> to numerous
problems in connection with his craft. But it could soon be
shown, by a reference to current practice, that this new law
could not be rigidly applied. And the shipbuilder, realizing
his own limitations and jealous of sharing his professional
mysteries with mathematicians and philosophers, was willing
to laugh the new theories out of court.</p>

<p>Again, of what practical use had been the discovery of the
“solid of least resistance” or of that “cono-cuneus” which
Dr. Wallis had investigated with a view to its application to
the bows of a ship? A final blow to the scientists was given
when the <i>Royal Katherine</i>, a three-decker of 80 guns, designed
by the council of the Royal Society, was found so deficient in
stability that it was deemed necessary to girdle her. Old
Shish had beaten Sir Isaac Newton and all the professors! The
impossibility of applying abstract scientific principles to so
complex a machine as a sailing ship, moving in elements so
variable as air and water, was patent to everyone. The
attitude of the professional may be judged from the resigned
language of William Sutherland, a shipwright of Portsmouth
and Deptford Yards, who in 1711 published his <cite>Ship-builder’s
Assistant</cite>:</p>

<p>“Though some of our preceding Master Builders have proposed
length as expedient to increase motion, yet it has seldom
answered; much extra timber is required to make them
equally strong. Besides, if the solid of least resistance be a
blunt-headed solid, extreme length will be useless to make
cutting bodies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
Again, in connection with the dimensions of masts:</p>

<p>“Though several writers say, that the velocities are the
square roots of the power that drives or draws the body;
from which it should be a quadruple sail to cause double
swiftness. Hence, unless the fashion is adapted to the magnitude
of the ship, all our Art can only be allowed notional, and
the safest way of building and equipping will be to go to
precedent, if there be any to be found. But this is a superfluous
caution, since ’tis very customary, that let a ship be
fitted never so well by one hand, it will not suit the temper of
another. Besides, the proper business of a shipwright is
counted an very vulgar imploy, and which a man of very indifferent
qualifications may be master of.”</p>

<p>Science was, in short, discredited. The corporation of shipwrights
had disappeared, not long surviving the fall of the
house of Stuart. No master-builder had succeeded the Petts
and the Deanes having sufficient influence and erudition to
expose the faulty system under which warships were now
built, English shipbuilding had once more become a craft
governed entirely by precedent and the regulations. The
professor was routed, and the practical man said in his heart,
There is no knowing what salt water likes.</p>

<p>Yet the science of naval architecture was at the dawn. Not
in this country, but in France, in the early part of the eighteenth
century, research and inquiry received such encouragement
from the State that it conferred on their fleets a superiority
of design which they retained for long: a superiority which
enabled them, in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">guerre de course</i> which was developed after
La Hogue under the intrepid leadership of men like Jean Bart,
Forbin, and Duguay-Trouin, to strike us some shrewd blows.</p>

<p>We propose to summarize as briefly as possible the principal
events which mark the evolution of the scientific side of naval
architecture.</p>

<p>A mere enumeration of the names and works of the men
who chiefly contributed to the discovery of the true natural
principles underlying the performance of sailing ships would
suffice to show the debt owed by the world to French effort,
and the tardiness with which this country faced the intellectual
problems involved. In the year 1681 a series of conferences
was held at Paris on the question of placing the operations of
naval architecture on a stable scientific basis; but before that
date, in 1673, Father Pardies, a Jesuit, had published the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
results of his attempts to calculate the resistance of bodies
moving in fluids with varying velocities. In ’93 the Chevalier
Renaud and Christian Huyghens were engaged in public controversy
on the merits and deficiencies of Pardies’ laws. In
’96 James Bernouilli entered the lists on Huyghen’s side, and
in the following year a remarkable work appeared from the
pen of another Jesuit, Paul Hoste, professor of mathematics
at Toulon. Father Hoste, having noticed the frequency with
which vessels of that time required girdling, had put the
question, why they should not be built initially with the form
which they had when ultimately girdled. The replies given
him being unsatisfactory, the professor investigated a whole
series of problems: the relation between speed and resistance,
the effect of form on resistance, stability, stowage, the properties
affecting pitching, and the best form of bow. Though
incorrect in much of his theory, he had admittedly a great
influence on later research. He was followed, in 1714, by John
Bernouilli, professor at Basle, whose investigations were purely
theoretical. And then, a few years later, M. Bouguer made
his great discovery of the <em>metacentre</em>, that all-important point in
space whose position in a ship, relatively to its centre of gravity,
marks with precision the nature of the vessel’s stability.</p>

<p>A treatise by Euler, entitled <cite>Scientia Navalis</cite>, was published in
1749, and a little later, stimulated by prizes offered by the
Société Royale des Sciences, Don G. Juan in Spain, Euler in
Russia, and Daniel Bernouilli in Germany, all published the
results of their investigations into the forces acting on a rolling
ship. Euler’s contribution was especially valuable. Treating
the ship as a pendulum he laid down two definite rules for the
guidance of shipbuilders, (1), not to remove the parts of a ship
too far from the longitudinal axis, (2), to make the most distant
parts as light as possible.</p>

<p>Up to this time the discoveries of the mathematicians had
had little practical effect on shipping. The abstruse form in
which new truths were published, and the lack of education
of the shipbuilders, prevented that mutual collaboration
which was necessary if the art of shipbuilding was to benefit
by the advances of science. Soon after 1750, however, a
succession of able men, possessed of imagination and initiative,
led inquiry into practical channels, and by actual trial
proved, incidentally, that much of the accepted theory was
faulty. The Chevalier de Borda, a naval captain and a member<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
of the Academy of Sciences, investigated with models the
resistance of fluids to motion through them, and enunciated
laws which shook confidence in current beliefs. The result was
a commission from the government to three eminent men,
M. D’Alembert, the Marquis Condorcet and the Abbé Bossut,
to report on and continue de Borda’s investigations. The
report, read by the Abbé before the Academy in 1776, confirmed
generally de Borda’s theories, and revealed new
problems—in particular, the alteration in shape of the free
water surface and the effect of wave resistance, the latter of
which was ultimately to be solved in this country by Mr. W.
Froude—that required investigation. The circumstances of
this commission illustrate the enlightened interest of the State
in the advancement of knowledge, significant testimony to
which was paid by Abbé Bossut. “M. Turgot,” he said of
the Comptroller-General of Finances, who took responsibility
for it, “who is not only an admirer of the sciences, but has
pursued the study of them himself amidst his numerous
important official functions, approved of our intentions, and
granted every requisite for prosecuting them.”</p>

<p>In the same year curious and important discoveries were
made by M. Romme, professor of navigation at La Rochelle.
In an endeavour to find the form of ship body which would
give good stability in conjunction with small resistance, he
ascertained the importance of the “run” or after part.
Hitherto the form of bow had absorbed attention to the almost
entire exclusion of the form of run, except in so far as it had
been shaped to allow water to flow freely to the rudder. M.
Romme called in aid methods which are now approved as
scientific, but which were then conspicuously novel: he
experimented by comparative trials between models in which
all variable features except one had been carefully eliminated.
He was rewarded by some new discoveries. By fixing the
length and successively varying the curvature of different parts
of his models he laid bare an important paradox. While at
low speeds the resistance was least when a sharp end was in
front and a blunt end in rear, at higher speeds the opposite
obtained. This accounted for a great deal of the contradictions
of previous investigators. M. Romme went further:
the curves by which the bow of a ship was connected with her
middle body, hitherto looked on as all-important, were shown
to be relatively immaterial. He astonished the world of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
science by proving that, given certain conditions, the resistance
upon an arc of a curve is the same as that upon the chord of
this arc. His deductions were proved by commissions to be
well founded. Experience confirmed that the form of the bow
curve did not much influence the resistance experienced in
passing through water; on the other hand the form of the
run was shown to have a far greater effect than had hitherto
been suspected.</p>

<p>In the year before M. Romme published the results of his
experiments a treatise appeared, full of empirical rules and
shrewd reasoning, by one of the greatest naval architects,
Henry de Chapman, chief constructor of the Swedish navy, an
Anglo-Swede who came of an old shipbuilding family of Deptford.
Chapman was a most gifted shipbuilder. Though his
formulæ were empirical, they were founded on careful observation
and induction, and his name ranks with those of Phineas
Pett and Anthony Deane in the history of naval architecture.</p>

<p>Nothing, so far, had come from English writers. “The only
English treatise on shipbuilding that can lay any claim to a
scientific character was published by Mungo Murray in 1754;
and he, though his conduct was irreproachable, lived and died
a working shipwright in Deptford dockyard.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> But indifference
was at last giving place to interest. Inspired by the formation
of the Society of Arts in 1753 (which Society was itself inspired
by the recognition, on the part of the founder, of the value of
prizes and rewards in improving our breed of racehorses) a
London bookseller named Sewell succeeded in 1791 in forming
a Society for the Improvement of Naval Architecture.
“Impressed with the many grave complaints which reached
him as to the inferiority of our warships as compared with
those of France and Spain,” he gained the interest of Lord
Barham and other influential men. A meeting was held at
which it was decided, as something of a novelty, that the
theory and art of shipbuilding were subjects of national importance;
that a radical deficiency in knowledge of the same
existed; and that the most effective remedy was a focussing
of the wisdom of the country on this matter by the institution
of the above Society.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
For a time the society flourished. A learned paper by
Atwood before the Royal Society, on the stability of a rolling
ship, proved that this country was not wholly destitute of
mathematical talent. An interesting series of experiments was
carried out for it by Colonel Beaufoy, a devoted student who
had made his first experiments on water resistance before he
was fifteen years old. It appears that his attention was first
drawn to the subject by hearing an eminent mathematician
state one evening that a cone drawn through water base foremost
experienced less resistance than with its apex foremost;
and it was said that sailors always took a mast in tow by the
heel. The paradox excited young Beaufoy’s curiosity. Before
bedtime, with the assistance of a neighbouring turner, he was
making experiments in one of the coolers in his father’s brew-house,
a large bunch of counting-house keys being put into
requisition as a motive power. Though the society was
dissolved in 1799 Beaufoy continued to pursue this subject
with unabated zeal until his death. In one direction, especially,
he did good work. Attracted by the frequency with which
North Sea fishing vessels, fitted with wells for carrying the fish,
foundered at sea, he showed experimentally the loss of stability
involved in carrying open tanks of water. He also demonstrated
to English builders by means of models that Bouguer’s
diagram of metacentric stability was of great practical value,
even for large angles of heel. “His experiments,” says Mr.
Johns, “should take an important place in the history of
stability of ships.”</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>We now revert to the beginning of the eighteenth century.
In the desultory warfare which was carried on during the
reign of Queen Anne events occurred to demonstrate the
superiority in design of the French warship over its English
opponent of the same nominal force. One in particular, an
expedition under Count Forbin which was intended to cover a
descent on the Scotch coast in favour of the Pretender,
“showed, even in failure, that in material France held a lead
on us.” Chased back to its ports from the latitude of Edinburgh
by larger English forces, Forbin’s squadron proved a
superiority over all our ships, both in speed and seaworthiness.
In weather which disabled many of our vessels the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
squadron arrived home with the loss of only three—and these
all English built.</p>

<p>At about the same time the capture by us of a 60-gun ship,
the <i>Maure</i>, of extraordinarily large dimensions for her rate,
showed the direction in which French design differed from our
own. The recapture, not long afterwards, of the <i>Pembroke</i>,
which was now found to carry only fifty, instead of her original
number of sixty-four guns, corroborated (says Charnock) the
direction in which improvement was sought and found.</p>

<p>But for some time the lesson remained unlearnt. For a
number of years the inferiority of our design was an accepted
fact; “every action won by British valour was a stigma to
British science.” Throughout the whole of this century we set
no value on scientific principles as applied to naval architecture,
and were content to remain copyists. Although before the
advent of the Napoleonic wars we had thus endeavoured to
reduce their balance of advantage, yet even so the French still
maintained an absolute superiority in design. In the first half
of the century this superiority was especially conspicuous; and,
in conjunction with an inferiority of seamanship and workmanship
which in the end more than neutralized all its advantages,
it was the cause of the disreputable incongruities which Charnock
has depicted in his well-known epigram: <em>Very few ships
captured by the enemy from the British have ever continued long
the property of their possessors. If it has so happened, that one of
them, being in company with others of French construction, has
ever fallen in with any English squadron, that ship, almost without
exception, has been among those captured, and most frequently
the first which has fallen. On the other hand, the recapture of any
ship from the British, which was originally French, is a circumstance
extremely uncommon. Captured French ships were sought
for as the best commands, which not infrequently were the means of
recapturing captured English vessels.</em></p>

<p>Very seldom was our failure to overhaul the speedy Frenchman
attributed to inferiority of design; nearly always to the
fortuitous circumstance that we were foul-bottomed and the
enemy clean; which may have been sometimes true, but
which was evidently a partial and inaccurate explanation.</p>

<p>We have already made mention of the periodic “establishments”
of dimensions to which ships built for the royal navy
were made to conform. The first of these, after the rules laid
down by the commissioners of James I, was decreed in 1655,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
when Blake was organizing a new standard navy. In 1677
dimensions were established for ships of 100, 90, and 70 guns,
but were exceeded in the case of those ships which were
actually built; and in ’91 a revised establishment for all
classes, very similar to those which previously governed
practice, appeared. In 1706 a new establishment was decreed,
a compromise between the ideas of the Surveyor and the
master shipwrights, in which the dimensions of each class were
slightly increased. The dimensions still remained small compared
with those of all foreign ships, however, and still “all
superior faculties of sailing were attributed to the mere length
of the vessel itself, without any but trivial regard to shape or
form of bottom.” Assuming that the ships built under this
establishment derived some slight advantage over earlier
construction on account of their augmented tonnage, yet this
was nullified when, in 1716, the force of their armament was
raised. As the work of a committee presided over by Admiral
Byng, a new establishment of guns was ordered, a change being
made in calibres but not in <span class="locked">numbers:—</span></p>

<p>First and second rates, instead of carrying 32-pounders on
the lower, 18-pounders on the main, and 9-pounders on the
upper deck, were ordered to carry, 42-pounders (or 32-pounders)
on the lower, 24-pounders on the main, and 12-pounders on the
upper deck. Eighty-gun ships, instead of carrying 24-pounders
on the lower, 12-pounders on the main, and 6-pounders on the
upper deck, were ordered to carry 32-pounders on the lower,
12-pounders on the main, and 6-pounders on the upper deck.
Seventy-gun ships, which in the previous century had carried
18-pounders on their main, and 9-pounders on their upper
deck, and which during the reign of Queen Anne had carried
24-pounders and 9-pounders, were now ordered to carry
24-pounders and 12-pounders. And so on with the smaller
rates.</p>

<p>In 1719 a new establishment for ships was decreed, the
dimensions slightly exceeding those of 1706, but being totally
insufficient for satisfactory construction. In ’32 and ’41
attempts were made to formulate new rules; but the master
shipwrights seem to have been loth to accept the lesson which
the French enemy was teaching them, and hesitated to recommend
any radical departure from traditional practice.</p>

<p>At length, in 1745, general complaint of the inferiority of
our ships in size and scantlings forced improvement on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
authorities. Spain, who had joined France in war against us,
possessed ships which exceeded in size even French ships of the
same rate. The capture in 1740 of a Spanish 70-gun ship, the
<i>Princessa</i>, by three of our ships, nominally of equal force with
herself but of far inferior dimensions and scantlings, is said to
have been the chief cause of the new reform. Their lordships
of the Admiralty, surveying naval construction in this country,
noted that our royal ships were weak and crank, while those of
other nations went upright. There was no uniform standard of
size, ships of the same class were of different dimensions, the
existing establishment was not adhered to. They therefore
decided on a new establishment, based on the latest armament
of guns; which should result in ships which would carry
their lower tier six feet above the water, and four months’
provisions.</p>

<p>The new standard was of little avail, for the same error made
some thirty years previously was now repeated: with the
augmentation of the ship dimensions the armament was also
raised in calibre. The first rates were ordered to carry the
42-pounder (which had before been optional) on their lower
deck; the 90-gun ships, 12-pounders on their upper decks;
the eighties, 18-pounders and 9-pounders instead of 12’s and
6’s; the seventies, which were only two hundred tons in excess
of the former establishment, 32-pounders and 18-pounders,
instead of 24’s and 12’s. “The ships, therefore, built by this
establishment proved, in general, very crank and bad sea-boats.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>This establishment was, in point of fact, little adhered to.
The war with France during the years 1744–8 repeatedly
revealed the defective nature of our ship design. Experience
pointed to the necessity either of reduced gun-weights or of
larger ships. Able administrators were now willing, under the
inspiration of such names as Hawke and Anson, to initiate
improvements. Our naval architecture at last took benefit,
though still by slow and cautious degrees, from foreign experience.
Some time was necessary for results to show themselves;
not only were new decisions slowly formed, but the rate of
building was deliberately slow. The <i>Royal George</i>, for instance,
described as “the first attempt towards emancipation from
the former servitude,” was ten years building. But, when war
broke out again in 1756, the improvements already embodied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
in the newest construction proved of considerable benefit. The
establishment of ’45 was given the credit. “The ships built
by the establishment of 1745,” says Derrick in his Memoirs,
“were found to carry their guns well, and were stiff ships, but
they were formed too full in their after part; and in the war
which took place in 1756, or a little before, some further
improvements in the draughts were therefore adopted, and the
dimensions of the ships were also further increased.”</p>

<p>To meet the advances in French construction a new classification
of rates took place, with French captured ships as models.
The capture of the <i>Foudroyant</i>, for instance, in 1758, provided
us with the form and dimensions of a splendid two-decked
84-gun ship. Our 80-gun three-deckers were thereupon
abolished, and no three-decker was thenceforth built with
fewer than 90 guns. The capture of the <i>Invincible</i>, in 1757,
gave us a valuable model for a 74-gun ship, a rate highly
esteemed, which bore the brunt of most of this century’s
warfare.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> From her was copied the <i>Triumph</i>, and other
experimental 74’s, with dimensions varying from those of the
<i>Invincible</i>, were at this time laid down. All 50-gun ships had
already dropped out of the line of battle; they were now
followed by the 60’s. No more 60 or 70-gun ships were built;
their places were taken by 64’s and 74’s respectively, of
relatively large size and displacement.</p>

<p>Nor was improvement confined to form and dimensions.
Attention was now paid to material. New rules were made for
the cutting and seasoning of timber, and for its economical use.
Sheathing was tried; in 1761 the frigate <i>Alarm</i> was sheathed
in copper for service in the West Indies, where the worm was
active. The copper was found to keep clean the hull, but at
the expense of the iron fastenings; so when, in ’83, copper
sheathing became general, an order was issued for all new
royal ships to be copper fastened up to the water-line: an
order beneficial on another count, since even without the
presence of copper sheathing, iron bolts had always been liable
to corrosion from the acids contained in the oak timbers.
Ventilation was also studied, more for its effects on the hull
timbers than on the health of the crews. The scantlings of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
ships were strengthened. Taffrails and quarter-pieces were
reduced in size, and the weight thus saved was devoted to
strengthening the sterns and reinforcing the deck supports;
additional knees and fastenings were provided throughout the
structure. Moreover, towards the middle of the century the
formation of the sails was gradually altered, first in the smaller
rates and afterwards in the larger ships. The old-fashioned
spritsail, which had been of greatest effect when going free, but
which had also been used with the wind abeam by the awkward
expedient of topping up its yard, gave place in our navy to the
fore and aft jib, which could be used with the wind before the
beam. Later the lateen sail on the mizzen gave place to a
spanker hung from a gaff or half-yard. These alterations had
a general effect on the size and position of masts and sails.</p>

<p>The order of 1745 was virtually the last of those rule-of-thumb
establishments which had imposed rigorous maximum
limits of length, beam and draught in conjunction with an
equally rigorous minimum of armament weight, and which had
been a glaring example of the evil effects of standardization
when unscientifically and unsuitably applied. The East India
service, the contract-built ships of which were designed by architects
untrammelled by the rules which cramped and distorted
the official architecture, provided the clearest proof that the
King’s ships were, as a whole, of poor design. Naval opinion
confirmed it.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>For further evidence that it was the system and not the men
at fault, we may note Charnock’s statement that, given a free
hand, Englishmen proved themselves better shipbuilders than
foreigners. “It stamps no inconsiderable degree of splendour
on the opinion which even the arrogance of Spain felt itself
compelled to hold in regard to the superior practical knowledge
possessed by the British shipwrights in the construction
and art of putting a vessel together, when brought in comparison
with that of their own people. The builders in all the
royal dockyards and arsenals, the Havanna excepted, were
Britons.”</p>

<p>How many, we may wonder, of the ships shattered by Lord
Nelson at Trafalgar were constructed by our countrymen?
The <i>Victory</i>, which was to bear his flag, was laid down (we may
note in passing) in the year 1759: she was 186 feet in length on
the gun-deck, 52 feet broad, and of 2,162 tons burthen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
In 1774 the American war broke out. The colonists, who
possessed a small but efficient frigate navy, were joined soon
afterwards by France, and then by Spain, and Holland. Lord
Rodney acknowledged the superiority of the French in speed,
who, though his ships were equally clean with theirs, yet had
the power daily to bring on an action. The war proved a rough
test for our honest but unscientific construction. “In 1778,
assailed by numerous enemies, England put forth all her naval
strength. Powerful fleets had to be found simultaneously for
the Channel, the North Sea, the East Indies, America, and the
West Indies. Five years of such warfare proved exhausting,
the ships on paying off in 1783 were in a terrible state of decay.
Several foundered returning home, owing to their ill-construction
and rickety condition; their iron bolts broke with the
working, and the ships were mere bundles of boards. All this
was owing to want of a better system of building, such as has
since been brought to such perfection by Sir R. Seppings.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>After the peace the size of the French ships continued to
increase, and every effort was made to improve their design;
but they were weak both in construction and material. Large
three-deckers were once more built; the <i>Commerce de Marseille</i>,
120, was of such extraordinary dimensions that English critics
thought that “size had now reached its ultimatum.” In 1786
the French abolished the use of shingle as ballast; it created a
damp vapour between decks and gave a high centre of gravity.
Iron ballast had been tried in the frigate <i>Iphigène</i> with great
success. “She was very easy in a sea when under her courses;
her extremities were not overloaded with cannon; she mounted
only 13 guns a side, whereas she had room for 15. She was the
best sea boat, and fastest sailing ship, perhaps, ever built. Her
length was more than four times her breadth.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>In England, as witnessed by the formation of the Society for
the Improvement of Naval Architecture, feeling was widespread
at this time that something was lacking in our methods of ship
construction. The navy was in process of reorganization by a
great administrator. In 1784 Sir Charles Middleton created
an establishment of naval stores. He took under consideration
shortly afterwards the growing scarcity of timber and its more
economical use. And in the course of his inquiry views were
expressed on naval shipbuilding which had an influence on
subsequent practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
The conditions under which ships were built for the East
India Company were far more scientific than those obtaining
in the royal dockyards. The timber was more carefully picked,
and better seasoned. The hulls were laid up under cover and
well aired; they stood in frame for six months, and then,
when the planks had been tacked on, they stood again, and no
tree-nails were driven till all moisture had been dried out of the
timber. In design they were in many ways superior; in fact,
they were reputed the best and safest vessels in Europe.</p>

<p>Mr. Gabriel Snodgrass, the Company’s surveyor, under
whose supervision, it was claimed, 989 ships had been built
and repaired between the years 1757 and 1794, only one of
which had been lost at sea, gave illuminating evidence. “I am
of opinion,” he said, “that all the ships of the navy are too
short, from ten to thirty feet according to their rates, And
if ships in future were to be built so much larger as to admit
of an additional timber between every port, and also if the
foremost and aftermost gun-ports were placed a greater distance
from the extremities, they would be stronger and safer,
have more room for fighting their guns, and, I am persuaded,
would be found to answer every other purpose much better
than the present ships. The foremasts of all ships are placed
too far forward; the ships are too lofty abaft, and too low
in midships; they would be much better and safer, if their
forecastles and quarter-decks were joined together; for if they
carry two, three, or four tiers of guns, forward and abaft, they
certainly ought to carry the same in midships, as it is an
absurdity to load the extremities with more weight of metal
than the midships. No ships, however small, that have forecastles
and quarter-decks, should go to sea with deep waists:
they certainly ought to have flush upper decks.”</p>

<p>Ships of the navy, he considered, were too weak; they had
plenty of timber, but were deficient in iron fastenings, brackets,
and standards. Knees should be of iron, which was lighter,
cheaper, and stronger than wood. The bottoms of all navy
ships were too thin; the wales and inside stuff too thick. He
particularly recommended diagonal braces from keelson to
gun-deck clamps: six or eight pairs of these, secured with iron
knees or straps, should prevent ships from straining as they
did. He would reduce the tumble-home given to the topsides,
and thus add to the strength both of hulls and masts; he
would abolish quarter-galleries and give less rake to the sterns.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
Finally, he would design ships so as to require a minimum of
compass timber; make no use of oak where he could substitute
fir or elm with propriety; and have all timbers cut as nearly
to the square as possible, to conserve strength.</p>

<p>His evidence, ending in a recommendation to the government
to improve the status of the naval shipwrights, has been
handed down as a remarkable exposition of sound knowledge
and good sense. The proposals were beneficial, so far as they
went, but they did not go far enough: the whole system on
which the hull timbers were disposed was wrong. The continuous
increase in the size of ships was gradually exposing
their weakness. And though in the next century a more
scientific disposition was to be adopted, for some years yet
construction continued on the ancient lines.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>The great wars with France, which broke out in the year
1792, found us adding both to the length and to the scantlings
of our new ships. Three years before, the Admiralty had
ordered two 110-gun ships to be built, of 2332 tons burthen.
One of them, the <i>Hibernia</i>, not finished till the year 1805, was
made more than eleven feet longer than originally intended.
Both of these ships were established with 32-pounder guns for
their main deck.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> The unwieldy 42-pounder, used on the
lower decks of first and second-rate ships, was now displaced,
in most ships, by the more rapidly worked 32-pounder. Lord
Keppel had tried, also, to substitute 32-pounders for 24-pounders
on the main deck of the <i>Victory</i> and other ships in
commission, so as to establish them generally; but they were
found too heavy on trial. He replaced 6-pounders by 12-pounders,
however, on the quarter-decks and forecastles.
Carronades were now making their appearance. In excellence
of material and honesty of workmanship our fleets were pre-eminent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
The value of large dimensions was by this time discerned;
where possible extra length was given to ships building and
those under repair. Size still increased. The great <i>Commerce
de Marseille</i>, brought home a prize by Lord Hood in ’94, was
forthwith matched by the <i>Caledonia</i>, which, ordered in this
year but not completed until 1810, was the greatest ship
which had ever been built in this country. Still, side by side
with news of world-shaking victories, came evidence of our
ships’ inferiority in design. Not only the French, but the
Spanish dockyards, produced vessels which could often
outsail ours. Four large prizes taken at the battle off Cape
St. Vincent surprised their new owners: “under their jury-masts,
and poorly manned as they necessarily were, they beat
all the English ships working into the Tagus.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>As the great wars went on, Britain deployed a constantly
increasing naval force. Prizes went to swell the number of
ships put in commission. “Mr. Pitt was foremost in getting
every possible ship to sea; and under this pressure rotten old
ships were doubled and cross-braced and otherwise strengthened
and rendered fully adequate to temporary service. Trafalgar
followed, and the efforts of the civil departments were rewarded.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>We have made little mention, in the foregoing pages, of the
actual tonnage or dimensions of ships, for the reason that the
figures would be for the most part unreliable or misleading
in import. The basis on which tonnage was measured was
constantly changing. It was difficult to obtain accurate
measurements of the principal dimensions; length, especially,
was an indeterminate dimension, and, in the days when a
large fore and aft rake was given, the length of keel gave no
indication of the over-all length. Even if the over-all dimensions
could be accurately measured, they gave small information
as to the form of the hull: the fullness or fineness of the
lines, the form of the bow-curves and tuck, the position of the
section of maximum breadth, both longitudinally and relatively
to the water-line—proportions on which the sailing
qualities of a ship largely depended. In the seventeenth
century the tonnage figures were generally untrustworthy;
the <i>Sovereign</i> was quoted by three different authorities as
being of 1141, 1637, and 1556 tons burthen. In the eighteenth
century tonnage and dimensions possessed greater comparative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
value. We confine ourselves to quoting the following table of
typical dimensions, taken from Charnock, showing the gradual
expansion which took place in the hundred years which have
just been reviewed.</p>

<p>The slow progress of naval architecture up to the end of
the eighteenth century, an advance the rate of which may be
gauged from the fact that, except for sheathing and pumps,
no important improvement was patented between the years
1618 and 1800, has been characterized as consisting mainly of
approximations to the successive forms and arrangements of
Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and French ships, all of which
had been in their turn superior to ours. Until the end of the
eighteenth century the “bigotry of old practice” had effectually
opposed any radical improvement, even though such
improvement had been operating for years in foreign navies
and were brought continually before the eyes of our professionals,
embodied in captured prizes. In his <cite>Naval Development
of the Century</cite> Sir Nathaniel Barnaby has drawn attention
to the remarkable similarity which existed between the
<i>Caledonia</i> of the early nineteenth, and the old <i>Sovereign</i> of
the seventeenth century: “Almost the only things of note
were the reduction in height above water, forward and aft,
and a slight increase in dimensions. The proportion between
length and breadth had undergone but little change. There
was almost the same arrangement of decks and ports; the
same thin boarding in front of the forecastle; the same mode
of framing the stern, the same disposition of the outside
planking in lines crossing the sheer of the ports; nearly the
same rig; the same external rudder-head, with a hole in the
stern to admit the tiller; and probably the same mode of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
framing the hull. For the ships of 1810 had no diagonal
framing of wood or iron, but the old massive vertical riders;
no shelf or waterway to connect the beams with the sides;
no fillings above the floor-head; and no dowels in the frames.
Ships were still moored by hempen cables, and still carried
immense stores of water in wooden casks.”</p>

<p>To Sir Robert Seppings was due the series of innovations
in constructional method which placed shipbuilding on a
relatively scientific basis and thereby rendered it capable of
meeting the increasing demands involved in the growing size
and force of warships. His scheme, some elements of which
had already been tested in H.M. ships, was described in a paper
read before the Royal Society in 1814. In the briefest language
we will attempt to explain it.</p>

<p>In the theory of structures, a jointed figure formed of four
straight sides is known as a <em>deficient</em> frame, since it has
not a sufficient number of members to keep it in stable equilibrium
under any system of loading. A triangle, on the other
hand, is a <em>perfect</em> frame, since it has enough, and not more
than enough, members to keep it in equilibrium however it
may be loaded.</p>

<p>The hull of a timber-built ship consisted of a number of
rigidly jointed frames or cells, some lying in horizontal, some
in vertical, and some in intermediate planes: the unit cell
being a quadrilateral, whose sides were formed by the frames
and vertical riders and by the planks, wales, and horizontal
riders. Practically all the materials composing the fabric of a
ship were disposed either in planes parallel to the plane of
the keel or in planes at right angles to it. And up to the end
of the Napoleonic wars our ships, without appreciable exception,
were built on this primitive quadrilateral system. The
system was essentially weak. All warships showed a tendency
to arch or hog—to become convex upwards, in the direction
of their length—owing to the fact that the support which they
derived from the water was relatively greater amidships than
in the neighbourhood of their extremities. In the old days
when ships were short in length this tendency was small, or,
if appreciable, a remedy was found in working into the structures
additional longitudinal and transverse riders, until the
holds were not infrequently clogged with timber. But as
ships increased in length, the forces tending to “break the
sheer” of a ship and arch its keel increased in greater ratio<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
than the ship’s power of resistance to the distortion; and by
the end of the eighteenth century, in spite of the aid of iron
knees, stronger fastenings, and improved material generally,
the essential weakness of our mode of construction had been
gradually exposed. The <i>Victory</i> herself suffered from arching.
The extremities of a 74-gun ship dropped six inches, sometimes,
when she entered the water from the stocks. A similar
tendency to hog took place also across the breadth of a ship,
occasioned by the dead weight of her guns. When rolling in
heavy weather the momentum of her top weights caused large
racking stresses to be thrown on the joints between the frames
and the deck-beams. The biographer of Admiral Symonds
quotes Captain Brenton as follows: “I remember very well,
when I was a midshipman in a 64-gun ship coming home from
India, cracking nuts by the working of the ship. We put
them in under the knees, as she rolled one way, and snatched
them out as she rolled back again.”</p>

<div id="ip_52" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20.75em;">
  <img src="images/i_p052.jpg" width="332" height="87" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATING DISTORTION OF FRAMES UNDER LOAD</div></div>

<p>From these remarks it will be clear that a new method of
construction which, by substituting the triangle for the rectangle,
prevented the distortion of a ship’s hull under the
stresses of hogging and sagging, would constitute an important
innovation: even more important if, in addition, the new
method resulted in a large economy of material. Such a
system Sir Robert Seppings introduced. Treating the hull as
a girder liable to bend, he disposed the timbers to the best
advantage to resist deformation. The rectangular system,
wherein frames and riders formed rectangular cells with no
other power of resisting distortion into rhomboids than that
derived from the rigidity of the joints, had been proved inefficient;
just as a common field gate would be inefficient, and
would easily distort, if built up solely of vertical and horizontal
timbers without any diagonal brace to make it a rigid figure.
He solved the problem with the triangle. By bracing each
quadrilateral cell with a diagonal timber he thereby divided
it into two rigid and immovable triangles, and thus made the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
whole ship rigid. The quadrilateral, when braced, was known
as a <em>trussed frame</em>. All the chief frames in the ships he trussed;
and since all bending took place from the centre of the ship
downwards to its ends, he made the trussed frames symmetrical
about the centre: the diagonals sloped forward in
the after body, and aft in the fore body, so as to resist the
arching by extension. The truss frame was embodied, not only
in the lower part of the vessel (where its effect in resisting
longitudinal bending was comparatively small), but in the more
nearly vertical planes, and even in the topsides between the
gun-ports (where it was most effective). Its use was estimated
to result in the saving of nearly two hundred oak trees in the
building of a 74-gun ship.</p>

<div id="ip_53" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22.125em;">
  <img src="images/i_p053.jpg" width="354" height="48" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">DIAGRAM REPRESENTING A SHIP WITH TRUSSED FRAMES</div></div>

<p>This was one element of Seppings’ system. The others were:
the filling in of the spaces between the ground frames of the
ship, so as to oppose with a continuous mass of timber the
tendency of the lower parts to compress longitudinally, and to
form a thick and solid bottom; the omission of the interior
planking below the orlop clamps; the connection of the beams
with the frames by means of shelf-pieces, waterways, and side
binding-strakes to the deck; and the laying of the decks
diagonally.</p>

<p>In two other important respects Seppings improved on
previous construction.</p>

<p>At Trafalgar the <i>Victory</i>, during her end-on approach to the
enemy line, was raked, and her old-fashioned forecastle, with
its thin flat-fronted bulkhead rising above the low head, was
riddled and splintered. This and similar experiences led to the
introduction by the Surveyor of an improved bow, formed by
prolonging the topsides to meet in a high curved stem, which
not only deflected raking shot, but also consolidated the bow
into a strong wedge-shaped structure supporting a lofty bowsprit,
and capable of being armed to give ahead fire from a
number of guns.</p>

<p>Similarly the weakness of ships’ sterns was remedied. The
broad flat overhanging stern which had been given to our ships<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
throughout the eighteenth century was not only structurally,
but defensively weak. In many actions, but notably in Admiral
Cornwallis’ fighting retreat from the French in 1795, the
weakness of our stern fire had been severely felt; and,
especially in view of the possible adaptation of steam to ship
propulsion, at this time foreshadowed, the desirability of an
improvement was evident. Seppings abolished the flat stern
in all new two- and three-deckers, substituting sterns circular
(as seen from above), more compactly embodied, and having
ports and embrasures in them for guns capable of fire along
divergent radii. The circular stern gave place, after a few
years, to an elliptical stern, which presented a more graceful
appearance and afforded increased protection to the
rudder-head. “The principal curves visible in it,” it
was said, “harmonize so well with the sheer lines of the
ship, that she appears to float lightly and easily upon the
water.”</p>

<div id="ip_54" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 26.9375em;">
  <img src="images/i_p054.jpg" width="431" height="359" alt="" /></div>

<p>In the opening years of the new century important advances
were made, too, in the organization of the royal dockyards.
The interests of naval architecture were served notably by Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
Samuel Bentham, brother of the famous jurist and an ex-shipwright,
who acquired honours in Russia and returned to
England to be Civil Architect and Engineer to the navy.
Bentham became a courageous Commissioner, and did much to
stamp out abuses and to encourage efficiency; he was instrumental
in checking the sale of stores, in abolishing “chips,” in
introducing steam pumps, block machinery, and dry dock
caissons, in improving the methods of building ships and of
mounting carronades.</p>

<div id="ip_55" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22.4375em;">
  <img src="images/i_p055.jpg" width="359" height="387" alt="" /></div>

<p>But still naval architecture, considered either as an art or as
a science, was stagnant. As a class the Surveyors were men of
very restricted education—“there is scarcely a name on the
list of any eminence as a designer or a writer.” Those who
ordered ships at the Board were “busy politicians, or amateurs
without a knowledge of science, or sailors too impatient of
innovation to regard improvements.” In no other profession,
perhaps, were theory and practice so out of sympathy with
each other. The native art of the builder was numbed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
shackled, by the restrictions imposed upon him as to tonnage
and dimensions; the study of ship form, with a view to
analysing the forces under which sailing ships moved by wind
through water and to discovering the laws which those forces
obeyed, was still mainly an academic pastime of the Society for
Improving Naval Architecture, and outside the province of the
naval authorities. Our ships were still formed on no rational
principle. Captured French ships served as models to be
copied. Often our builders would make fanciful variations
from the originals—a little more sheer, a little more beam, etc.
etc.—and as often they spoiled their copies. Whenever they
followed closely the forms and features of the originals they
succeeded in producing vessels which were pronounced to be
among the best ships in the navy.</p>

<p>With this state of affairs, it is no matter for surprise that
much of the new construction of the period was of small value.
“Sir Joseph Yorke produced a set of corvettes, longer and
narrower than brigs, none of which answered; and they were
sold out of the service. Then came the ‘Forty Thieves,’ a
small class of 74’s; but in justice to the designer, Sir H. Peake
(who copied them from a French ship), it must be added that
his lines were altered by the Navy Board, and the vessels were
contract-built. Lord Melville built half a dozen ‘fir frigates,’
which neither sailed nor stood under canvas. The 22-gun and
28-gun donkey frigates ‘could neither fight nor run away’;
it was dangerous to be on board them; and the bad sailing of
such vessels was the chief cause of our ill success in the
American War. The old 10-gun brigs, or ‘floating coffins,’ as
they were significantly styled, were equally dangerous and
unsightly. They had no room to fight their guns; no air
between decks, which were only five feet high; extra provisions
and stores were piled above hatches; and the fastest of them
sailed no more than eight or nine knots.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>The merchant service was in even worse plight. The tonnage
rules had had a deplorable effect upon merchant shipping. The
ancient method of assessing a ship’s burthen was by measuring
the product of its length and breadth and depth, and dividing
this by a constant number, which varied, at different periods,
from 100 to 94. Early in the eighteenth century, however, a
simplification was innocently made: the depth of the average
ship being half the beam, a new formula was approved—length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
multiplied by half the square of the beam, divided by 94.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
The result might have been anticipated. Dues being paid
only on the length and breadth, vessels were given great depth
of hold, full lines, and narrow beam. Absolved by the convoy
system from trusting to their own speed for self-protection,
English merchantmen became slugs: flat-bottomed, wall-sided
boxes, monstrosities of marine architecture of which it was said
that they were ‘built by the mile and served out by the yard.’</p>

<p>To raise the skill and status of our builders, the Committee
of Naval Revision of 1806 presided over by Lord Barham
advised the establishment of an official school, in which the
more highly gifted apprentices might study the science involved
in naval architecture. In 1811 the school was opened at Portsmouth,
with Dr. Inman, a senior wrangler, as president. Ships
were designed by Dr. Inman and his pupils excellent in many
respects, and generally on an equality with those of the
Surveyor and the master shipwrights. Yet still they were very
imperfect. The official designs were hampered, not only by the
hereditary prejudices and dogmas and by the cautious timidity
of the builders themselves, but by the restrictions still imposed
by the Navy Board, who insisted on a certain specified armament
in combination with a totally inadequate specified
tonnage: who laid down incompatible conditions, in short,
under which genius itself must fail of producing a satisfactory
result.</p>

<p>The chains were broken in 1832.</p>

<p>In that year, when the whole administration of the navy was
in process of reorganization, the office of Surveyor was offered
to and accepted by a naval officer, Captain W. Symonds, R.N.:
accepted by him on the condition that he should be given a free
hand in design and allowed to decide himself of what tonnage
and dimensions every ship should be. Sir Robert Seppings was
superannuated. The school of naval architecture was abolished.
The sensation produced was powerful. “Except on matters of
religion,” said Sir James Graham, when the appointment was
being debated in the House of Commons some years afterwards,
“I do not know any difference of opinion which has been
attended with so much bitterness—so much anger—so much
resentment, as the merits of Sir W. Symonds and the virtues
of his ships.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
These violent differences and resentments have long since
been composed, and Sir William Symonds has been accorded
the position due to him in the history of naval architecture.
His opponents, those who had resented his appointment as
against the best interests of the service, rejoiced that he had
freed ship design from the traditional restrictions under which it
had stagnated; his chief admirers were led in the course of
time to agree in the desirability of having as Surveyor a man
thoroughly grounded in the scientific principles underlying the
motion of bodies through water, their stability in water, and all
the forces acting on a ship at sea.</p>

<p>In the year 1821 Lieutenant Symonds, while holding an
appointment at Malta, had designed and built for himself a
yacht which he called <i>Nancy Dawson</i>. Yachting had at this
date become a national sport, and the interest of influential
patrons in sailing matches was already acting as a stimulus to
the study of ship form. The chief cause of the beneficial
reaction from the indifference of former generations, says his
biographer, was the establishment of the Yacht Club, after the
peace of 1815, and the interest which men of rank and fortune
henceforth took in shipbuilding, and in procuring the best
native models.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> So great was the success of the <i>Nancy
Dawson</i>, that (in his own words) he was led to believe that he
had hit upon a secret in naval architecture; while experiments
on other sailing boats seemed to confirm him in his principles.
Great breadth of beam and extraordinary sharpness—in fact,
what was described as “a peg-top section”—were the
characteristic features of his system, with a careful attention to
stowage, the stand of the masts, and the cut and setting of
the sails.</p>

<p>“Upon this most slender basis was the whole fabric of Sir
William’s subsequent career built. The yacht gained him the
notice of noblemen and others, then followed a pamphlet on
naval architecture (in which the defects of existing ships were
pointed out, and great breadth of beam and rise of floor
advocated); then came a promise from the First Lord of the
Admiralty, Lord Melville, that he should build a sloop of war
on his plans, which he did, the vessel being called the <i>Columbine</i>
(promotion intervening); then further patronage from the
Duke of Portland and the Duke of Clarence, the latter of whom,
when he became Lord High Admiral, ordered him to lay down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
a 40-gun frigate (promotion again intervening); then the
building of the <i>Pantaloon</i>, 10-gun brig, for the Duke of Portland,
from whom the Admiralty purchased her; then the patronage
of that most mischievous civilian First Lord, Sir J. Graham;
then the order for the <i>Vernon</i>, 50-gun frigate; and then, in
’32, the Surveyorship of the Navy.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>To Sir Edward Reed and other shipbuilding officers the
appointment of this brilliant amateur to the supreme control
of the department seemed an act of war, not only on professional
architects, but upon naval architecture itself.
They admitted the success of the Symondite ships in speed and
certain sailing qualities, but denied the correctness of his
principles and strenuously resisted his innovations. A great
breadth of beam was particularly objectionable to the scientific
builder; not only did it imply a large resistance to the passage
of the ship through water, but it contributed to an excess in
metacentric height, abnormal stiffness, and an uneasy motion.
“For a time his opinions triumphed; but after a while the
principles expounded by his subordinates (Creuze, Chatfield,
and Read) were accepted as correct, while not a single feature
of Sir William’s system of construction is retained, except
certain practical improvements which he introduced.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless his opponents, as before remarked, freely
acknowledged the value of his services to the country, especially
in breaking down the restrictions which had hitherto been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
imposed on constructors in respect of dimensions. His
biographer pays tribute to the intuitive genius which enabled
him to tell at a glance the trim required for a sailing ship, and
to sketch out, as a brilliant impromptu, the best form of hull.
But were these efforts entirely spontaneous? Were they not
the reward of hidden and persistent work, observation, and
calculation, carried out for years by the young officer who never
let a sailing ship come near him without contriving to board her
and ascertain her principal properties and dimensions? Here,
surely, is the undramatic but praiseworthy method by which
he attained success: a method, essentially scientific, which
enabled its user, even without knowledge of other important
principles governing ship design, to perform a national service
in revolutionizing our methods of naval architecture.</p>

<p>Under the control of Sir William Symonds the improvement
in the form and qualities of our ships, begun under the surveyorship
of Sir Robert Seppings, continued to progress. Ship
dimensions increased, and now bore a more correct relation to
the dead-weight of armament, stores, and crew, which they had
to carry. All classes from cutters to first-rates carried a more
generous beam, and gained by the novel feature. Sounder
rules were devised, partly as the result of a succession of sailing
trials, for the pitching of masts and the methods of stowing. In
short, naval architecture entered upon a new and promising era.
Foreign observers recorded the progress made. Instead of
being servile imitations of the products of French and Spanish
models the vessels which flew the English flag became objects
of admiration to all the world.</p>

gunpowder took place writers have held the most
divergent views. The opinion of the majority has
been that its properties were known in the remote ages of

the accounts given of its origin by most of the medieval
writers. The Chinese claim to have known it long before the

the broad ground of probability, it has been inferred by some
authorities that the explosive properties of gunpowder were
known to the ancients. The wonderful property of saltpetre,
they argue, must certainly have been known to the wise men
of old: its extraordinary combustive power when mixed with
other substances. Melted alone over a hot fire saltpetre does
not burn; but if a pinch of some other substance is added, a
violent flame results. In many fortuitous circumstances, they
say, saltpetre must have been found in contact with that other
essential ingredient of gunpowder, charcoal. And such a circumstance
has been pictured by one writer as occurring when
camp fires, lit upon soil impregnated with nitre (like that in
parts of India), were rekindled; the charred wood converted
into charcoal forming with the nitre a slightly explosive
mixture.</p>

<p>Other investigators maintain that gunpowder, which claims
a spurious antiquity, is really an invention of the Middle Ages.
Incendiary compositions—Greek fire, and other substances
based on the properties of quicklime, naphtha, phosphorus, etc.—were
undoubtedly known to the ancient world. But explosive
compositions, based on saltpetre as the principal ingredient,
were certainly not known in all their fearful power.
The silence of history on the subject of the projection of
missiles by explosive material, says a recent authority,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
eloquent; the absence of its terminology from such languages
as Chinese and Arabic, conclusive.</p>

<p>Whichever of the two views may be correct it is certain
that a knowledge of gunpowder was possessed by the great
alchemist, Roger Bacon, who in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1249 committed to
paper an account of its properties.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> To Berthold the Black
Friar is given the credit for its application to military ends;
whom legend, in an impish mood, has hoisted with his own
discovery.</p>

<p>In a learned work on the early days of artillery an English
writer has described the difficulties encountered in tracing
the first stages of the evolution of guns and gunpowder. Confusion
was caused by the fact that, after gunpowder had been
introduced, military engines were still known by the same
generic names as those borne in pre-gunpowder days. No
contemporary pictures of guns could be discovered. The
loose statements of historians, the license of poets, and the
anachronisms of the illuminators of the medieval MSS., all
tended to lead the investigator astray and to make his task
more difficult. The statements of the historians are indeed
whole hemispheres and centuries apart; as for poets, our own
Milton assigned the invention of artillery to the devil himself;
and “from the illuminators we should gain such information
as, that Gideon used field pieces on wheeled carriages with
shafts, when he fought against the Midianites, as in a MS. in
the British Museum.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>Of all the clues which throw light on the origin of artillery
the most important yet discovered lies in some MSS. belonging
to the city of Ghent. After a list of municipal officers for the
year 1313 occurs the entry: “Item, in this year the use of
bussen was first discovered in Germany by a monk.” And there
is evidence that in the following year “guns” were manufactured
in Ghent and exported to England.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> The same
century was to witness a wonderful development of the new-found
power.</p>

<p>It was but natural that the first application of gunpowder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
to warlike purposes should have been, not only to strike
terror by violent explosion and thus obtain an important
moral effect, but to project the missiles already in military
use: arrows and ponderous stones. Two distinct types of
artillery were thus foreshadowed. The first took the form of
a dart-throwing pot or vase, a narrow-necked vessel from
which, in imitation of the cross-bow, stout metal-winged arrows
were fired; while, for projecting stones of great size and weight
in imitation of the ancient siege-machines, large clumsy pieces
made of several strips of iron fitted together lengthways and
then hooped with iron rings were eventually developed.</p>

<p>In the first half of the fourteenth century the guns manufactured
were of the former type. In <cite>The Origin of Artillery</cite>
a reproduction is given of an illuminated MS. belonging to
Christ Church, Oxford, dated 1326, showing an arrow-throwing
vase: the earliest picture of a gun which is known. And, from
a French document quoted by Brackenbury, it appears that
in 1338 there was in the marine arsenal at Rouen an iron
fire-arm—<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pot de fer</i>—which was provided with bolts (“carreaux,”
or quarrels) made of iron and feathered.</p>

<p>But the unsuitability of the arrow for use in conjunction
with gunpowder as a propellant was, even at this date, realized.
There was obvious difficulty in preventing the powder gases
from escaping through the windage space between the arrow-shafts
and the neck of the vase, even with the aid of leather
collars. So the arrow almost immediately evolved into a
stone or metal sphere; the narrow neck of the vase increased
to the full diameter of the vessel. And as early as 1326, the
date of the picture of the arrow-throwing vase, cannon of
brass, with iron balls, were being made at Florence for the
defence of the commune. The use of the new weapons quickly
spread. By 1344 the cannon is mentioned by Petrach as “an
infernal instrument of wood, which some think invented by
Archimedes,” yet “only lately so rare as to be looked on as a
great miracle; now, ... it has become as common as any other
kind of weapon.” By 1412, according to unquestionable testimony
supplied by public documents, cannon were employed in
English ships: breech-loading guns with removable chambers.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
In 1346 Edward III fought Cressy. Whether or no cannon
were used in this decisive battle has been a matter of considerable
controversy. According to Villani, an old Florentine
chronicler who gave an account of the campaign, they were;
but no mention of them was made by Froissart, who wrote
some years later. The silence of Froissart has been attributed,
however, to a desire to avoid offending our court by implying
that the victory was due to other than the prowess of the
Prince of Wales; or tainting our success with any mention of
“devilish machines which were universally regarded as
destructive to valour and honour and the whole institution of
chivalry.” Though English chronicles contain no mention of
gunpowder till some years after Cressy, yet evidence exists
that artillery—“gunnis cum sagittis et pellotis”—was extensively
used in this campaign. “But the powder was of so feeble
a nature and the cannon so small, that the effect of a few of
them, fired only a few times, could not have been very noticeable
compared with the flights of arrows.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>Cannon in the first half of the fourteenth century were
indeed feeble weapons compared with the huge mechanical
engines of the period; yet their moral effect was very great
and their physical effect by no means negligible. They were
destructive of chivalry, in a quite literal sense. The value of
cavalry as an arm was greatly reduced by their adoption in
the field. They took from the horseman cased in complete
armour all the advantage he possessed over other troops.
Instead of forming the nucleus of the fighting strength of an
army, the armour-clad nobles and their mounted retinues
became somewhat of an encumbrance, and a change in the
composition and strength of armies from this time ensued.
Tournaments went out of fashion, chivalry declined.</p>

<p>Against material, cannon proved even more effective. As
the arrow-throwing gun gradually disappeared, giving place to
small cylindrical cannon firing lead and iron balls, other
ordnance, designed for projecting large stones against the
gates and walls of forts and castles, grew rapidly to an enormous
size. Made usually of forged iron bars welded and strengthened
circumferentially by coils of iron ribbon or rope, and using a
weak gunpowder, these giant “bombards” began to play an
important part in land warfare, especially in those internecine
wars which were constantly being waged in Flanders and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
Northern Italy. Two peoples were conspicuous at this period
for their wealth, culture, and energy: the Lombards and the
Flemings. The former, by their contact with the East, had
drawn into their hands most of the commerce of Europe; the
latter, welded together in the Hanseatic League, were in the
van of northern civilization. It was in Italy, probably, that
cannon were first employed, and in Italy where they developed
most rapidly. Their use had an immediate effect on land
warfare; the defensive value of masonry was suddenly depreciated,
and town-gate, fort, and campanile, which had for
centuries defied the old mechanical engines, could no longer
be considered impregnable.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>In the following century the development of the bombard
continued. The Lombards cast them in bronze, adorned them
with elaborate mouldings and furnished their ends with
swellings like capstan-heads, of equal diameter, to facilitate
rolling and parbuckling. In the hands of the Flemish artisans
this type reached a remarkable degree of perfection in a
famous bombard called “Dulle Griete,” which was made at
Ghent about <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1430. The bombard of Ghent consists of
two parts, a larger part to form the barrel for the stone sphere
of 25 inches diameter, a smaller part, of much thicker metal,
to form the chamber in which the powder charge is placed.
These two parts are screwed together, screw threads being
formed on a boss on the front end of the chamber and in a
hole in the rear end of the barrel. This is thought to be the
piece described by Froissart as “une bombarde merveilleusement
grande, laquelle avoit cinquante trois pouces de bec, et
jetoit carreaux merveilleusement grands et gros et pesants;
et quand cette bombarde descliquoit, on l’ouoit par jour bien
de cinq lieues loin, et par nuit de dix; et menoit si grand’ noise
au descliquer, que il sembloit que tous les diables d’enfer
fussent au chemin.”</p>

<p>A fine example of the built-up bombard is “Mons Meg,”
the piece which now lies at Edinburgh Castle, and which was
made at Mons about <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1460: formed of longitudinal
wrought-iron bars welded and hooped circumferentially, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
20 inches in the bore, and designed to fire a stone ball of over
three hundred pounds’ weight.</p>

<p>It was in the hands of the Turks, then at the zenith of
their power, that medieval ordnance achieved its greatest
development, and it is thought probable that Flemish pieces
served as the model on which the Ottoman artillery was based.
The siege of Constantinople, in the year 1453, was notable for
“the reunion which it presented of ancient and modern
artillery—catapults, cannon, bullets, battering rams, gunpowder
and Greek fire.” And it was especially notable from
the power of the modern artillery there assembled, an artillery
which represented a climax of size and military value. Gibbon
has given us a vivid description of the Ottoman ordnance and
its capabilities. “Mahomet studied with peculiar care the
recent and tremendous discovery of the Latins; and his
artillery surpassed whatever had yet appeared in the world.
A founder of cannon, a Hungarian, a deserter from the Greek
service, was liberally entertained by the Sultan. On his
assurance a foundry was established at Adrianople; the metal
was prepared; and at the end of three months Urban produced
a piece of brass ordnance of stupendous and almost incredible
magnitude; a measure of twelve palms is assigned to the bore;
and the stone bullet weighs above six hundred pounds. A
trial was held, a proclamation having warned the populace.
The explosion was enormous and was heard one hundred
furlongs off, and the ball, by the force of the gunpowder, was
hurled above a mile.”</p>

<p>“A stranger as I am to the art of destruction,” continues the
historian—who, we may note in passing, had been through his
courses at Hilsea and was a major in the Hants Militia—“I can
discern that the modern improvements of artillery prefer the
number of pieces to the weight of metal; the quickness of fire
to the sound, or even the consequence, of a single explosion.
Yet I dare not reject the positive and unanimous evidence of
contemporary writers; nor can it seem improbable that the
first artists, in their rude and ambitious efforts, should have
transgressed the standard of moderation.... The great
cannon, flanked by two fellows of almost equal size, was set up.
Fourteen batteries thundered at once against the walls, one of
which contained 130 guns! Under a master who counted the
minutes, firing could take place seven times in a day.”</p>

<p>Interesting corroboration of Gibbon’s account has since been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
discovered in a MS. by a contemporary Greek writer, found
at Constantinople in the year 1870.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> According to this
chronicler the cannon are actually cast on the field of action.
Mahomet summons the gunmakers and discourses with them
on the kind of ordnance required to beat down the walls of the
city. They reply that larger cannon are necessary than any
they possess; and they suggest melting down the pieces
available to form others of sufficient size and power. The
Sultan commands the thing to be done. Quantities of plastic
clay are kneaded, linen and hemp and threads being mixed
with it to stiffen it for forming gigantic moulds. Furnaces are
erected, and charged with copper and tin. Bellows are worked
for three days and three nights, and then, the metal being
ready, the molten mass is poured. Within sight of the
beleaguered city huge cannon are cast which, placed on
wooden sleepers on the ground with their butts supported to
prevent recoil discharge stones weighing nearly 700 pounds
against the walls.</p>

<p>But there is no need of documentary evidence to attest the
power of the Ottoman artillery of this period; cannon built on
the above model have guarded the Dardanelles for centuries,
and, what is more, have proved sufficiently effective in modern
engagements. In 1807 Sir John Duckworth’s squadron was
struck repeatedly by stones of enormous weight, discharged
from these cannon in an attempt to prevent its passage. And
it is known that some of them were made shortly after the
taking of Constantinople. These cannon, says General Lefroy,
were cast on their faces, “the dead-head being left at the
breech-end and hewn off with axes, probably while the metal
was hot.” In one of them brought home to England “the axe
marks are plain; similar marks may be observed on other
early guns which have the breech cut off square.” The similarity
of design between this Turkish gun and the Flemish
bombards is too close to be accidental; their construction is of
peculiar interest and has the main features in common. “The
external form of the gun is a cylinder, the muzzle being as large
as the breech; but either half is relieved by a boldly projecting
moulding at each end, which is divided transversely by
sixteen cross-bars into as many recesses: thus serving to give
a purchase to the levers used in screwing the two parts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
together.” How the screw threads were cut is not known, but
“we can suppose that moulding pieces were first cut in wood
and nicely fitted and then applied to the clay moulds.” The
charge of powder used with this type of piece was as much as a
hundredweight. In spite of the weakness of the squib-like
powder its physical and moral effect was undoubtedly important.
“Thus inconceivable and incredible,” writes the
chronicler of 1467, “is the nature of this machine. The ancient
princes and generals did not possess and had no knowledge of
such a thing.... It is a new invention of the Germans or of
the Kelts made about one hundred and fifty years ago, or a
little more. It is an ingenious and happy discovery, especially
the powder, which is a composition made of saltpetre, of
sulphur, of charcoals, and of herbs, from the which composition
is generated a dry hot gas....”</p>

<p>The founding of these enormous cannon on the field of
action is in itself a tribute to the energy and resourcefulness of
the nation who have been described as being, at that time, the
finest engineers in the world. Of the effectiveness of the
Ottoman artillery there is evidence in the results achieved.
Constantinople fell to the giant bombards. And in the early
part of the following century Rhodes, the last outpost of the
Knights, fell to the same great power. The invention of the
Christians<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> was, in fact, the weapon which gave supremacy to
the Infidel in the eastern part of Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
In the meantime the evolution of artillery was taking a new
direction. The large and relatively feeble ordnance of the
Turks was, in the circumstances, not entirely unsuitable for
the purpose for which it was intended: the smashing of
masonry and the breaching of gates and walls. The maximum
of effect was obtained from a missile of enormous mass projected
with a low velocity. Nevertheless its disadvantages
were obvious. Large cannon cast in bronze were necessarily of
great expense and weight, their discharges were few and far
between, they wore rapidly and were thus short-lived, and
they possessed the dangerous property of becoming brittle
when heated. An increase in power and a reduction in weight
were required for the achievement of a portable artillery, and
the progress of mechanical science pointed to wrought iron as
the material of which such an artillery might be made.</p>

<p>The extraction of iron in small quantities from ferruginous
ore was a comparatively simple operation, even in primitive
times. With the aid of bellows and a plentiful supply of wood
charcoal the smith was able to make his furnace yield small
masses of metallic iron of the purest quality. This iron,
wrought on an anvil, could be drawn out into plate or bar as
desired, the resulting metal being, by reason of the purity of
the charcoal used in its extraction, of great toughness, homogeneity,
and strength. In Spain and Italy were mines which
had long been famed for their iron. In England the Roman
had made good use of the metal found in the Sussex mines, and
all through the middle ages the wealds of Kent and Sussex were
the centres of the English iron trade. In the fourteenth
century improved methods came into use; the adoption of
water-power for driving the bellows, for crushing the charcoal,
and for operating the tilt-hammers, had its effect on the
development of the iron-smelting industry; higher temperatures
obtained and larger masses of ore could now be treated;
the iron, produced in larger quantities by improved methods,
was perhaps purer and stronger than before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
In wrought iron, then, a material was available which
almost alone was suitable for the manufacture of the more
portable sorts of gun. By its use guns could be made strong
enough, without being of an excessive weight, to withstand the
increasing stresses thrown on them, first, by the use of iron
bullets instead of stone, and secondly, by the discovery of an
improved gunpowder. Artillery underwent a dual development.
On the one hand, for use with the weak cannon powder,
was the large stone-throwing ordnance, made of cast bronze or
of hooped bars of iron; on the other, for use with iron shot and
a stronger propellant, were various denominations of small
portable and semi-portable wrought-iron guns. These two
distinct types developed side by side until the middle of the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The use of iron and lead balls, the superiority of which over
balls of stone had doubtless been manifested in former
centuries in connection with the projection of Greek fire, was
practised by the Florentines soon after the invention of guns
themselves. The discovery of “corned” gunpowder took
place a century later.</p>

<p>In its original form gunpowder possessed many disadvantages
as a propellant. Ground into a fine powder, and composed
in the first instance of almost equal proportions of
saltpetre, sulphur, and charcoal, it was peculiarly liable to
accidental explosion, so that frequently the charcoal was kept
separate from the other ingredients and mixed just prior to use.
If kept mixed it easily disintegrated, in the shaking of transport,
into three strata, the charcoal coming to the top and the
sulphur sinking to the bottom. It was intensely hygroscopic,
and quickly fouled the barrels of the pieces in which it was
used. But, most important of all, the efficiency of its combustion
depended to an inconvenient degree upon the density
with which, after being ladled into the gun, it was rammed
home. The greatest care had to be exercised in ramming. If
pressed into too dense a mass the powder largely lost its
explosive character; the flame which ignited the portion
nearest the vent could not spread through the mass with
sufficient speed; it quietly petered out. If rammed too
loosely, on the other hand, the explosive effect was also lost.
A great gain ensued therefore when, in place of the fine or
“serpentine” powder, corned powder came to be used, about
the middle of the fifteenth century. In this form the powder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
was damped and worked into grains, crushed to the requisite
size and sieved for uniformity. These grains were finally
glazed to prevent deterioration from the effects of damp; and
the resulting powder proved stronger and more efficient in
every way than the same mixture in its more primitive form.</p>

<p>Some time was to elapse before guns could be cast of
sufficient strength to withstand the force of corned powder.
“Chemistry had outrun metallurgy.” The larger species of
ordnance were restricted to the use of serpentine powder until
the middle of the sixteenth century. Nevertheless, cast
ordnance as well as the lighter forged iron guns were developed
continuously for service in the field. Named after birds and
reptiles and clumsily cast of such shapes and weights as pleased
the founders’ fancy, they were of use chiefly in demolishing by
attrition the gates and walls of forts and cities. From the
battle of Cressy onward, first in huge carts and then on their
own wheeled carriages, they rumble across the pages of
European history.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>At sea the evolution of ordnance had to conform, of course,
to the progress of naval architecture and the changing nature of
the warfare. In the Mediterranean, where the oar-propelled
galley remained for centuries the typical fighting ship, the
bombard was planted in the bows, shackled to a deck-carriage
upon the centre line, to give ahead fire and to supplement the
effects of a powerful ram. As the galley developed, the main
central gun became flanked by other bow-chasers; while on
the beams and poop light wrought-iron breech-loading swivel
guns formed a secondary armament whose double function was
to repel boarders and to overawe its own slave-crew. In the
Atlantic, where the typical fighting vessel was the lofty sailing
ship, the same two different types of armament had vogue.
But in this case their distribution was different; the sailing
ship, with no recourse to oars for manœuvring, could not
always ensure an end-on attack or defence, and had to arm
herself against an enemy from any quarter. Her freedom from
oars, her height, and the invention of the porthole, enabled the
early “great ship” to mount a sufficiently distributed all-round
armament. While her sides were pierced for ponderous
bombards, her poop and forecastle bristled with the same light
secondary armament as figured in the Mediterranean galley.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
This artillery was almost entirely for defence. Before Elizabethan
days (as we have already noted) sea battles were
nothing more than hand-to-hand fights; the attacking vessel
was laid alongside its enemy, sails were furled, and boarding
took place. If, after being swept by spherical shot from the
bombards and showers of stones and dice from the mortars and
periers, the boarders could carry the waist of the defending
ship, they still had to capture the barricaded forecastle and
poop, from whose rails a multitude of the smaller ordnance—port-pieces,
fowlers, serpentines—were trained upon them and
behind whose bulkheads crossbow and harquebuss were plied
against them in concealment.</p>

<p>The sixteenth century witnessed the greatest strides in the
evolution of sea ordnance. In the Mediterranean the decisive
effect of gunfire, proved in the sea fight off Prevesa in the year
1538, was confirmed by the victory of the Christians over the
Turks at Lepanto in 1571. In the Atlantic England began her
long preparation for securing a sea supremacy and, under the
masterful eye of King Henry VIII, adapted more and more
powerful guns for service in the royal ships. Of the professional
interest which the King took in the development of ordnance
there is ample evidence. At the royal word French and Flemish
gunfounders were induced to come to England to teach the
technique of their craft, and to this puissant prince the Italian
savant, Tartaglia, dedicated his classic treatise on the Art of
Shooting. England now learnt to found, not only bronze, but
<em>cast-iron</em> cannon. “Although,” says Grose, “artillery was
used from the time of King Edward III and purchased from
abroad by all our successive Kings, it seems extremely strange,
that none of our workmen attempted to cast them, till the
reign of King Henry VIII, when in 1521, according to Stowe,
or 1535 (Camden says), great brass ordnance, as canons and
culverins, were first cast in England by one John Owen, they
formerly having been made in other countries.” And from
Stowe’s Chronicle he quotes the following: “The King
minding wars with France, made great preparations and
provision, as well of munitions and artillery as also of brass
ordnance; amongst which at that time one Peter Bawd,
a Frenchman born, a gun-founder or maker of great ordnance,
and one other alien, called Peter Van Collen, a gunsmith, both
the King’s feedmen, conferred together, devised and caused to
be made, certain mortar pieces, being at the mouth from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
11 inches, unto 19 inches wide; for the use whereof, the said
Peter and Peter caused to be made certain hollow shot of cast
yron, stuffed with fire-works, or wild-fire; whereof the bigger
sort for the same had screws of yron to receive a match to carry
fire kindled, that the fire-work might be set on fire to break
in small pieces the same hollow shot, whereof the smallest piece
hitting any man, would kill or spoil him. And after the King’s
return from Bullen, the said Peter Bawd by himself in the first
year of Edward VI did also make certain ordnance of cast yron
of diverse sorts and forms, as fawconets, falcons, minions,
sakers and other pieces.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> The casting of iron guns in Germany
has been traced back as far as the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>According to another account the first English cast-iron
guns were made at Buxted, in Sussex, by one Ralph Hogge in
1543. Peter Bawd, the French founder, was an assistant who
had come to this country to teach him the method. But it
seems that his connection with Hogge was not of long duration;
for, “John Johnson, covenant servant to the said P. Bawd,
succeeded and exceeded his master in this his art of casting
ordnance, making them cleaner and to better proportion.
And his son, Thomas Johnson, a special workman, in and
before the year 1595 made 42 cast pieces of great ordnance of
iron, for the Earl of Cumberland, weighing 6000 pounds, or
three tons a-piece.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>The advance made in the power of King Henry’s sea
ordnance is unmistakably shown from trustworthy documents.
There is a continuous progress during the reign, and ships
which were rebuilt subsequently carried an armament entirely
different from that which they originally had. The <i>Sovereign</i>,
for instance, built about the year 1488, originally carried one
hundred and eighty guns, mostly small serpentines. As
rebuilt in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1509 she carried an armament which included
four curtalls, three demi-curtalls, three culverins, two falcons,
and eleven heavy iron guns. From an inventory of the
armament of the <i>Henry Grace à Dieu</i>, of 1514, it appears<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
that that historic ship was then armed with a miscellaneous
collection of pieces, comprising 122 iron serpentines, 12 “grete
yron gonnes of oone makyng and bygnes,” 12 ditto “that
come owt of fflaunders,” all with separate chambers; 2 “grete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
Spanish peces of yron of oone sorte,” with chambers; 18
“stone gonnes apon Trotill wheles,” with chambers; “ffawcons
of Brasse apon Trotill wheles”; one “grete bumberde of
Brasse apon iiij trotill wheles”; two “grete culverynes of
Brasse apon unshodd wheles”; as well as a “grete curtalle of
Brasse upon iiij wheles,” a sling, vice pieces, and serpentines
of brass on wheels shod with iron. Rebuilt at a later date the
<i>Henry</i> carried a different armament, which included brass
cannons, demi-cannons, culverins, demi-culverins, sakers, and
cannon-periers.</p>

<p>The transition of armament is plainly marked for us in the
case of the <i>Mary Rose</i>, rebuilt in 1536, which nine years later
came to an untimely end off Brading. At the time of her oversetting
she carried, in fact, both types of ordnance. In the
Rotunda at Woolwich are to be seen some of the guns recovered
from her wreck: a built-up wrought-iron breech-loading
stone-throwing gun on its baulk-of-timber carriage, identical
in character with a serpentine illustrated in Napoleon III’s
<cite>Études sur l’Artillerie</cite> as having been taken by the Swiss from
Charles the Bold in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1476; and a bronze cannon royal
(with John Owen’s name on it), demi-cannon, culverin, and
culverin-bastard, all of them finished specimens of the founder’s
art, and of an offensive, instead of a merely defensive, value.
“The system,” says Mr. Oppenheim of this growth of artillery
armament, “was extended as the reign progressed, and in
1546 we find comparatively small ships like the <i>Grand Mistress</i>
carrying two demi-cannon and five culverins, the <i>Swallow</i> one
demi-cannon and two demi-culverins, out of a total of eight
heavy guns; the <i>Anne Galant</i> four culverins, one curtall, and
two demi-culverins,” etc. etc.</p>

<p>What were the dimensions of the various pieces? It is
difficult to give an exact answer. Owing to the continuous
development of ordnance throughout the century the pieces
increased in size while they retained their class-names, and
there is a wide variation between the table of ordnance of
Tartaglia, for instance, compiled in 1537, and those drawn up
by English authors at the beginning of the seventeenth
century. Briefly, we may note that pieces could be grouped
in four classes: viz. cannons, culverins, periers, and mortars.
The cannons were large in calibre and of medium length; the
culverins were of great length, to give them high ranging
power; the periers, or stone-throwers, were a sort of howitzer;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
and the mortars, named probably from the apothecary’s
utensil to which they bore a resemblance, were squat pieces
used for projecting stones or iron balls at a high elevation.
The old stone-throwing serpentine was a gun weighing about
260 pounds, which fired a stone “as big as a swan’s egg.” The
curtall, or curtlow was (according to Mr. Oppenheim) a heavy
gun of some 3000 pounds, hitherto only used as a siege-piece
on land; “courtaulx” are mentioned by Napoleon III as
having been, in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1498, fifty-pounders weighing 5500 livres.
The slings were large breech-loaders, probably of the perier
class.</p>

<p>With the adoption of a more powerful armament not only
did the old pieces disappear, but a simplification of calibres
ensued. France led the way in the standardizing of calibres;
about the year 1550 the French king Henri II introduced his
six “calibres of France.” In the English navy at this period
several types were discarded, and a limit was set to the size
of the largest ship gun. “The report drawn up in 1559 tells
us that there were 264 brass and 48 iron guns, all of calibres
down to falconets, on board the ships, and 48 brass and 8 iron
in store.... The heaviest piece used on shipboard was the
culverin of 4500 lbs.; throwing a 17⅓ lb. ball with an extreme
range of 2500 paces; the next the demi-cannon weighing
4000 lbs. with a 30⅓ lb. ball and range of 1700 paces; then the
demi-culverin of 3400 lbs., a 9⅓ lb. ball and 2500 paces; and
the cannon petroe, or perier, of 3000 lbs., 24¼-lb. ball and
1600 paces. There were also sakers, minions, and falconets,
but culverins and demi-culverins were the most useful and
became the favourite ship guns. A contemporary wrote, ‘the
founders never cast them so exactly but that they differ two
or three cwt. in a piece,’ and in a paper of 1564 the average
weights of culverins, demi-culverins, and cannon periers are
respectively 3300 lbs., 2500 lbs., and 2000 lbs.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>So far, cast iron had not come into general use. The large
iron guns were built up like the early Flemish bombards;
the demi-cannons and culverins were all of brass. At the
beginning of Elizabeth’s reign there seems to have been an
attempt to replace the expensive brass by the cheaper cast
iron, but later there was a reversion to brass, and it was not
until the following century that cast iron was generally recognized
as a material for heavy ordnance, and then only for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
heaviest types. Some technical considerations may help to
indicate the chief factors which determined the material and
the dimensions of the Elizabethan ordnance.</p>

<p>Writing in 1628, Robert Norton, in his book <cite>The Gunner</cite>,
refers as follows to the early Tudor ordnance. “Gun-founders
about 100 or 150 years past,” he says, “did use to cast ordnance
more poor, weak, and much slenderer fortified than now, both
here and in foreign parts: also the rather because saltpetre
being either ill or not refined, their sulphur unclarified, their
coals not of good wood, or else ill burnt, making therewith also
their powder evilly receipted, slenderly wrought, and altogether
uncorned, made it prove to be but weak (in respect of
the corned powder used now-a-days), wherefore they also
made their ordnance then accordingly (that is much weaker
than now). For the powder now being double or treble more
than it was in force of rarification and quickness, requireth
likewise to encrease the metal twice or thrice more than before
for each piece.” And, in fact, the weight of cannon increased
in the period mentioned from eighty to two hundred times, the
weight of culverins from a hundred to three hundred times,
the weight of their shot. The slender large-bore built-up guns
of the <i>Henry Grace à Dieu</i> could only be used with a weak
slow-burning powder. At the same time this slow-burning
powder required, for its complete combustion, a great length of
gun. These guns, such of them as were breech-loaders, must
have suffered from the leakage of gas at the joints of their
primitive chambers; in the case of the smaller pieces a serious
inefficiency was the excessive windage allowed between shot
and gun. Until the end of the sixteenth century the windage
bore no direct relation to the diameter of the shot or bore of the
gun: it was a fixed amount, one quarter of an inch. The effect,
therefore, of the leakage of powder gases past the shot, the loss
in efficiency of discharge, was greatest in the smallest guns.</p>

<p>The lines along which improvement lay were those which
were taken. First, an elimination of the smallest guns.
Second, a return to muzzle loading. Third, a strengthening of
the powder by corning. Fourth, a further fortifying and a
general augmenting of the weight of the cast pieces, which had
the double effect of giving the necessary strength to meet the
stronger powders coming into use,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> and of giving the extra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
mass required to minimize the violence of their recoil. Cast
iron could not yet compete with well-found brass for the guns
required. Demi-cannon proved too unwieldy, and as Elizabeth’s
reign progressed, gave place more and more to the
long-ranging culverins, demi-culverins, and sakers, “which
strained a ship less, were served more quickly and by fewer
men, and permitted a heavier broadside in the same deck
space.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> As powder grew stronger the conditions improved;
smaller charges were necessary, windage had less effect, and,
owing to the quicker combustion, it was possible to shorten
the pieces without detracting seriously from their ranging
power; and this was done in the Queen’s Navy, the guns
being thereby made lighter and more easily manipulated,
while at the same time their projecting muzzles were less
liable to entangle and interfere with the tackles of the sails.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>The substitution of the powerful, safe, and easily manipulated
demi-cannon and the long-ranging culverin and demi-culverin
in place of the old chambered ordnance of the first
half of the century made possible a new form of naval warfare.
The cannon at last became, in the hands of the Elizabethan
seaman, the chief instrument of battle. Off-fighting was now
feasible: a mode of action which largely neutralized the
effects of an enemy’s superiority in size of ship or number of
men, and which gave full scope and advantage to superior
seamanship. Though no high standard of gunnery efficiency
was then possible, yet it was the great superiority of the English
gunfire, principally from the demi-culverins, the sakers, and
the minions, over that of Spain, which conduced more than
any other factor to the dispersal and subsequent flight of the
Invincible Armada. The gun was the weapon on which the
English seaman had learnt to rely. It was the gun, plied with
rapidity just out of pistol-shot of his lofty ships, which in the
year 1588 harassed and put to confusion the Spaniard, the
haughty fighter who still maintained a quixotic contempt for
the use of cannon and esteemed artillery “an ignoble arm.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
What a volume of fire was poured against him may be seen
from a letter written by the admiral, Lord Howard of Effingham:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
“All the world,” he writes, “never saw such a force
as theirs was; and some Spaniards that we have taken, that
were in the fight at Lepanto, do say that the worst of our four
fights that we have had with them did exceed far the fight they
had there; and they say that at some of our fights we had
twenty times as much great shot plied as they had there.”</p>

<p>By this time the founding of guns in cast iron had made
progress. Cast iron was cheap, and of a greater hardness and
endurance than bronze, but more like to crack and fly and
endanger the crew, and requiring an enormous expenditure
of wood-charcoal for its production. The use of mineral coal
for iron smelting was not discovered until the following
century, and even then, because of the opposition of the vested
interests, it was long before it displaced the use of timber. In
the Tudor times the iron and brass foundries were nearly all
in the wooded south of England. The rivers of Sussex and
Kent had for centuries been dammed to form hammer-ponds,
and the sound of the tilt-hammers was heard throughout
these counties. To such an extent were the forests depleted
of wood to form fuel for the Wealden foundries, that serious
inroads were made on the available supplies of shipbuilding
timber; legislation was required in Elizabeth’s reign to
prevent the charcoal-burner from robbing the shipwright of his
raw material.</p>

<p>Gun-founding, even in bronze, was still a somewhat primitive
art. But, once taught, the English founders soon excelled
their teachers; and Norton’s eulogy, and the records of foreign
efforts to obtain possession of English pieces, bear witness to
the superiority of our workmen. The products of the most
famous founders of that time in Europe were very imperfect.
“Some of their pieces (and not a few) are bored awry, their
soul not lying in the midst of the body of metal; some are
crooked in their chase, others of unequal bores, some too light
towards the breech turn their mouths downwards in their
discharge, and so endanger their own vawmures and defences;
others are too heavy also in their breach, by placing the
trunnions too much afterwards, that coynes can hardly be
drawn.... Some are come forth of the furnace spongey, or
full of honeycombs and flaws, by reason that the metal runneth
not fine, or that the moulds are not thoroughly dryed, or well
nealed.... Yet thus much I dare say to the due commendations
of our English gunfounders, that the ordnance which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
they of late years have cast, as well for neatness, as also for
reasonable bestowing and disposing of the metal, they have far
excelled all the former and foreign aforementioned founders.”
Norton, a land gunner, was here referring to brass ordnance,
alone used on shore.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting witness to the success of
the English gunfounders is Sir Walter Raleigh, who in his
<cite>Discourses</cite> rebuked the detestable covetousness of those
licensed to sell ordnance abroad. So great was the number of
pieces exported, that all other nations were equipped with
good English artillery for ships and forts and coast defence.
“Without which,” he remarks, “the Spanish King durst not
have dismounted so many pieces of brass in Naples and elsewhere,
therewith to arm his great fleet in ’88. But it was
directly proved in the lower house of parliament of Queen
Elizabeth, that there were landed in Naples above 140
culverins English.... It is lamentable that so many have
been transported into Spain.”</p>

<p>In 1589 Lord Buckhurst wrote to the justices of Lewes Rape,
complaining of their neglect in permitting the surreptitious
export of ordnance. “Their lordships do see the little regard
the owners of furnaces and the makers of these pieces have of
their bonds, and how it importeth the state that the enemy of
her Majesty should not be furnished out of the land with
ordnance to annoy us.”</p>

<p>It is not improbable, in short, that some of the Armada’s
cannon had been moulded and poured on English soil.</p>

<p>The imperfection of the sixteenth-century foundry products
may be gauged from Bourne’s evidence that the use of cartridges
was inconvenient because, on account of honeycombs
and flaws, “you shall scant get the cartridge home unto the
bottom of the piece.” On the other hand loading by ladle was
still considered dangerous. In his <cite>Art of Gunnery</cite>, of 1627,
Thos. Smith, soldier, of Berwick-on-Tweed, warns the gunner
always to stand to one side of the mouth of the piece when
thrusting home the ladle; otherwise, the charge being ignited
by smouldering débris in the cavities of the metal, it takes
fire and kills the loader—“as happened in Anno 1573 at the
siege of Edinborough Castle, to two experienced gunners.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
At about the same date as Smith’s book was written, Sir H.
Manwayring, in <cite>The Sea-Man’s Dictionary</cite>, described the
“arming” of cross-bar shot: i.e. the binding them with
oakum, yarn, or cloth, to prevent their ends from catching hold
in any flaws during their passage through the gun, which might
break it.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>Under the Stuart kings a continuous development of ship
armament took place.</p>

<p>This development was not always in the right direction.
The Commission of Reform of the year 1618 recorded, as we
have already seen, the importance of artillery in naval warfare,
but owing to the absence of all system it was long before the
principle found effective application. Owing to divided
authority, or to a lack of unity in the conception of the fighting
ship, a tendency to excess in the number and weight of guns
continued to be noticeable, an excess which was to react
unfavourably on the performances of our ships both in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</p>

<p>Progress was made in the classification of pieces and in
the reduction of the number of different types carried; a
change was also made in the forms of the guns, in order to
enhance the fighting value of the gun armament in certain
circumstances. The great guns were made still shorter than
before; the quicker-burning powders now in use allowed this to
be done. By which expedient the ratio between gun-weight
and weight-of-metal-thrown was reduced; more guns could
be carried for a given weight of metal; they could be more
easily manipulated; and if they were of small ranging power
they yet possessed a power of penetration sufficient for close-quarter
fighting. Moreover, the reduction in length enabled an
increase in calibre to be made; and this was one of the factors
which led to the reintroduction of larger types than had
formerly been considered suitable: the cannon-serpentine,
the cannon, and even the cannon-royal, with its sixty-six pound
shot and its eight thousand pounds of metal.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
In the Dutch Wars the preponderance in the size and weight
of the unit shot lay with the English ships, and was in itself
undoubtedly a great advantage in their favour; though
complaints were made of the great weight and clumsiness of the
pieces, “which caused much of the straining and rolling
at sea.” Writing of naval ordnance in the year 1690, Sir
Cloudesley Shovell recorded that, “our lower-deck guns are
too big and the tackles ill fitted with blocks, which makes them
work heavy; the Dutch who have light guns have lignum
vitæ sheaves. The Dutch guns are seldom larger than twenty-four
pounders.” By this time, it will be noted, the more
scientific nomenclature had come into vogue; the cannon-petro
was now known as the 24-pounder, and the heavy
lower-deck guns referred to were the old bastard-cannons,
known since the reorganization of the Commonwealth navy as
42-pounders.</p>

<p>The founding of guns continued to be, throughout the
seventeenth century, an affair of private enterprise. Proof
was carried out under the supervision of the Board of Ordnance.</p>

<p>In 1619 a decree was issued that gun-founding was to be
confined to Kent and Sussex, that guns were to be landed at
or shipped from the Tower Wharf only, and that East Smithfield
was to be the one market-place for their sale or purchase.
Guns could be proved only in Ratcliff fields, and all pieces were
to have on them at least two letters of the founder’s name,
with the year and the weight of the gun. Exportation was
illegal; nevertheless the illicit traffic went on just as in
Elizabeth’s time. The royal forts themselves were turned into
marts for these and other unlawful transactions, and Upnor
Castle is described as having been “a staple of stolen goods, a
den of thieves, a vent for the transport of ordnance.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>In later years proof took place at other government grounds,
all within the London area. In Moorfields, according to Stowe,
was the Artillery Yard, “whereunto the gunners of the Tower
do weekly repair; and there, levelling certain brass pieces of
great artillery against a butt of earth made for that purpose,
they discharge them for their exercise.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> Spitalfields also had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
its artillery butts. “Where Liverpool-street Station now
stands the Tower gunners of Elizabeth’s day had their yard,
and there discharged great pieces of artillery for exercise, while
throughout the seventeenth century guns were both cast and
tested in the vicinity, as Gun-street, Fort-street, and Artillery
Lane hard by serve to remind us. Finsbury Field, levelled for
an archery ground in 1498, passed from the London archers to
the London gunners, and, as the Honourable Artillery Company’s
Ground, survives to carry on the long traditions of
the spot.”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>Under the Commonwealth progress was made in the quality
of gunpowder, and improved methods were introduced of
testing it for strength and uniformity. This advance had its
effect on the guns. Failures were frequent, and, in spite of
improved founding, pieces had to be made heavier than before;
cast iron in particular was found unequal to withstanding the
stresses caused by the improved powders, and this metal came
into such disfavour that a whole century elapsed before it was
again accepted as suitable by both naval and military artillerists.
Founding in bronze had undergone improvement.
Malthus, an Englishman who had risen in the French service
to be Director of their Artillery,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> mentions in his <cite>Pratique de la
Guerre</cite>, as evidence of this improvement, the fact that in
breaking up old pieces lumps of free tin and copper were
frequently discovered, whereas in the case of new guns the
metal was invariably found well-mixed.</p>

<p>Somewhere between the years 1665 and 1680—presumably
later than 1667—the proof of ordnance was transferred from
Moorfields to the naval depôt at Woolwich, and the nerves of
the metropolis were no longer shaken by the roar of pieces
loaded with powder charges equal, for proof, to one-and-a-half
times the weight of the shots themselves. A proof-master and
“his Majesty’s founder of brass and iron ordnance” were
instituted to supervise and advise the various contractors.
The State did not at first take over the work of casting its own
guns. But in 1716 an event occurred which brought about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
formation of the Royal Gun Factory, and the manufacture of
both land and sea ordnance by the state. A disastrous
accident occurred in the City of London. It happened that,
after the peace of Utrecht in 1713, the guns captured by
Marlborough from the French had been exhibited outside the
Moorfields foundry. Three years later they were still there, and,
the national ordnance being much depleted by the late wars, it
was resolved to recast these pieces and so utilise their metal.
On the appointed date a large concourse of the public attended
to witness the operation. Late at night the metal was poured.
A big explosion ensued, owing to the use of damp moulds, and
a number of people were killed and injured.</p>

<p>To avoid a recurrence of such an accident it was decided
that the government should possess a brass foundry of their
own. The services of an able foreigner, Andrew Schalk of
Douai, were sought, and the Royal Foundry at Woolwich was
established with Schalk as master founder. The change was a
complete success, and Schalk held the position for the next
sixty years. Some of his guns, cast in the year 1742, were
raised from the “Royal George” in 1840.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>By the middle of the eighteenth century the processes of
gunnery had been placed for the first time on a scientific
foundation; by whom, and in what manner, we shall describe
in a later chapter.</p>

<p>The design of guns had by this time become subject to more
scientific consideration than had hitherto been bestowed, and
their manufacture had been improved by the Swiss invention
of the boring machine, which enabled them to be cast solid
instead of being cast hollow on a core. Iron guns came more
and more into favour as the century progressed, especially for
naval use. The cost of iron was only one-eighth that of brass.
The art of casting iron in homogeneous masses had by this
time made progress, and though hitherto it had been the
custom to make iron ordnance of great thickness and weight,
repeated trial proved that they could be made lighter, if
required, without undue loss of strength, and that in action
they outlasted brass ordnance, which cracked, bent at the
muzzle, and wore out at the vent. A well-made iron gun was
almost indestructible. At the siege of Belleisle, in the Seven
Years’ War, the brass guns soon wore out, and had to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
replaced by iron ship guns; and it was long, indeed, before a
suitable brass was discovered, which would withstand the
repeated fire of large charges without losing its tin-element and
degenerating into a spongy and craterous material. Muller,
in his <cite>Treatise of Artillery</cite>, of 1768, described how he had seen
cast iron at the Carron works so tough that “it would flatten
and tear like brass”; and advocated iron guns of a new and
light construction to replace Schalk’s brass guns forming the
armament of the <i>Royal George</i>, and give a saving in weight of
over a hundred and sixty tons.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>FRENCH TWENTY-FOUR-POUNDER WITH SPHERICAL CHAMBER</p>

<p class="smaller">From St. Remy’s <cite>Mémoires</cite></p></div></div>

<p>In respect of design, the newly acquired knowledge of the
true principles governing internal ballistics began gradually,
in the latter part of the century, to show its effect. Hitherto,
ever since gunpowder had been in military use, pieces had
been cast in masses of varying size and shape and ornamented
to please the fancy of the founder. Cannon had been made with
double or triple reinforces of metal, so that their exterior
surface was stepped longitudinally from muzzle to breech.
Experience probably pointed out on many occasions the bad
design of a piece whose sections showed sudden alterations in
shape; but it was not till after the middle of the eighteenth
century that this consideration was discussed by a professional.
“Since powder acts uniformly and not by starts it is hard to
judge from whence this ridiculous custom has arisen....
There should be no breakings in the metal.” The piece,
continues Muller, should be of cylindrical bore, and its outer
contour should be a curve slightly concave, corresponding
presumably to the curve of the powder pressure. But as this
curve would be difficult to find, he recommends a sloping
straight line from breech to muzzle as sufficiently exact for
practical purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
Innumerable experiments were made in the first half of this
century with a view to improving the efficiency of combustion
in guns, and much argument centred round such subjects as the
shape of the chamber and the position of the vent. In France
pieces were adopted having spherical chambers: it being
proved that, with the charge concentrated in a spherical cavity,
as much power could be obtained as from a larger and heavier
flush-chambered gun. But such pieces were dangerous. Not
only was their recoil so violent as to break their carriages, but
many good gunners lost their arms while charging chambers in
which smouldering debris lay hidden. The spherical chamber
was abandoned.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>It may be said that the design and manufacture of guns has
now entered the scientific stage. Art there still is, but it lies
below the surface. The old “vain ornaments” preserved by
tradition are thrown away: the scrolls, mouldings, and
excrescences which broke the surface of the metal; the ogees,
fillets, and astragals which ran riot over the products of some
foundries; the muzzle swells which by their weight caused the
chase to droop; the grotesque cascabels. All mouldings, said
Muller, should be as plain and simple as possible; the trunnions
should be on the axis of the piece; the windage of all types of
guns should be smaller, and there should be more moderation in
the charges used.</p>

<p>In time all these improvements came. The smooth-bore gun,
strengthened and simplified, preserved its establishment in the
navy far into the nineteenth century, as will later appear. For
the present we must confine ourselves to noting that, in the
final stages of its evolution it received improvement in form
from two distinguished artillerists whose influence was progressive
in the whole realm of gunnery: Generals Congreve<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>
and Blomefield.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> There is yet another eminent officer of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
period to whom the navy owes a debt incalculable: Who can
assess the value of the work done by General Sir Howard
Douglas in his classic treatise on Naval Gunnery?</p>

<p>To the foregoing survey of the evolution of heavy ordnance
we now append a few notes on the evolution of the material
of purely land artillery: from which it will be seen that, while
the intensive competition of great armies resulted in much of
this latter evolution originating among the continental powers,
the share of this country in initiating improvement was, in the
latter years, by no means negligible.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>It will be noted by the student of European history as
significant, that superiority of artillery material has almost
invariably marched with national power. Thus in the past
the evolution of artillery has been the monopoly of no one
nation; it has been progressed by each in turn; each in turn
has attained superiority, and each has contributed something
of importance to it, in the day of its greatness.</p>

<p>Two ancient and preventable practices seem to have operated
in chief measure to retard the progressive development of a
mobile land artillery: first, the custom of setting the trunnions
of a gun at an appreciable distance below the horizontal plane
of the gun-axis; second, the custom of making small pieces
relatively longer than those of larger calibre.</p>

<p>The first guns had no trunnions. To obtain the requisite
angle of elevation the piece was laid in a dug-out trunk or
carriage and this carriage was set on trestles; in which
manner, it appears, the English at the siege of Orleans in
<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1428 “threw into the town from their bombards large
numbers of stones which, flying over the walls, smashed in
the roofs of houses.”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> During the fifteenth century trunnions
came into use, and the carriages were mounted on wheels.
In his <cite>Introduction of Artillery into Switzerland</cite> a French writer,
Colonel Massé, has given an account of the early evolution of
an artillery of position, as used by the Swiss and their enemies
in the fifteenth century. The huge siege bombards, possessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
by most of the great cities at the end of the fourteenth century,
were too cumbrous for transport. Built up of welded and
coiled iron, and therefore without trunnions, they were
replaced, toward <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1443, by lighter pieces on wheeled
carriages. And before the Burgundian War “coulevrines de
campagne” were being cast in Switzerland, of bronze, with
trunnions to give each piece an elevation independently of its
carriage. Relics are still preserved which show the gun-trunnion
in its early stages, as embodied in the Burgundian
artillery of Charles the Bold. The first method of obtaining
elevation for the gun was by hinges or trunnions on the front
of the carriage or trunk, in combination with a curved rack
erected on the trail for supporting the rear end. Then the
trunk disappeared; the trunnions were cast on the gun,
whose cascabel was supported by a cross-pin between the
flanks of the trail; and then the cross-pin was made removable,
and a series of holes was provided for its reception, to give the
elevation desired. At first these trunnions were cast level
with the gun axis; in Napoleon III’s treatise on artillery is
a picture of a trunnion gun taken by the Swiss from Charles
the Bold in 1476, and another of a cannon of Louis XI,
cast in 1478, and in both cases the trunnions are level with
the gun axis. But pieces cast later almost invariably had
their trunnions set on a level with the bottom of the bore;
partly, perhaps, for the insignificant reason given by Norton—that
“lying somewhat under the concave cylinder of the
bore they will the better support the great weight”—but
primarily to ensure a downward pressure on the quoin or trail
when discharge took place. The effect of this trivial alteration
was enormous. The impulse of the recoil was given a moment
about the trunnion axis which, as the force of powders increased,
produced an increasingly great downward pressure
on the trail. Carriages, though made of massive scantlings,
frequently broke; nor was it till the latter half of the eighteenth
century that the cause was removed, the trunnions being raised
nearer the axes of the guns and the carriages being thereby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
relieved of the excessive cross-strains which they had borne
for nearly three hundred years. Muller, in his Artillery, refers
to the “absurd method” of placing the trunnions so low and,
in the year 1768, points out the advantages to be gained by
raising them. “Writers do not appear to have had any idea,”
says Favé, “of the effect which the position of the trunnions
had on the stressing of the carriage.” Scharnhorst the Prussian
gives as an important advantage to be gained by raising the
trunnions, the larger wheels which could be employed without
adding to the height of the gun above the ground.</p>

<p>Progress was also checked by the great length given to the
smaller varieties of cannon. With the fine powder of the
Middle Ages a great length of barrel was necessary to ensure
complete combustion, and such primitive observations as were
made all seemed to prove that, the longer the barrel the greater
the range. But with the introduction of corned powder a
reduction in length should have been possible. No such
change was made. Tradition had consecrated long guns, and
official standardization of types afterwards helped to oppose
any innovation in this respect until the eighteenth century,
with few exceptions.</p>

<p>To Charles V of Spain belongs the credit for the first systematic
classification of guns. In his hands artillery had, for the
first time, become an efficient instrument of battle in land
campaigns, and all Europe saw that, in his batteries of bronze
trunnion-guns, on wheeled carriages, firing cast-iron balls
against foe or crumbling masonry, a new power had arisen.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>
The emperor, experiencing the inconvenience of a multiplicity
of types and calibres, sought to simplify his material.
Accordingly, in the year 1544 or shortly before, he approved
seven models to which all pieces in use throughout the vast
possessions of the Spanish monarchy were thenceforth to
conform. These seven types comprised a cannon (a 40-pounder),
a cannon-moyen (24-pounder), two 12-pounder culverins, two
6-pounder culverins, and a 3-pounder falcon.</p>

<p>The French soon improved on Charles’ example. The oldest
patterns of their cannon, according to a table given by St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
Remy in his <cite>Mémoires</cite>, were of a uniform length of ten feet. In
<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1550 Henri II issued an edict restricting the number of
different calibres to six, named as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>Canon, a 33-pounder, 10½ feet long, weighing 5200 livres,
drawn by 21 horses.</p>

<p>Grande coulevrine, a 15-pounder, 11 feet long, weighing 4000
livres, drawn by 17 horses.</p>

<p>Coulevrine bâtarde, a 7-pounder, 9 feet long, weighing 2500
livres, drawn by 11 horses.</p>

<p>Coulevrine moyenne, a 2-pounder, 8½ feet long, weighing
1200 livres, drawn by 4 horses.</p>

<p>Faucon, a 1-pounder, 7½ feet long, weighing 700 livres,
drawn by 3 horses.</p>

<p>Fauconneau, a ¾-pounder, 7 feet long, weighing 410 livres,
drawn by 2 horses.</p></blockquote>

<p>These dimensions are only a rough approximation. In the
year 1584 two other types, found useful by the Spaniards in
the Low Countries, were included—a 12- and a 24-pounder.</p>

<p>The relatively greater lengths of the small pieces will be
noted. As it was with the French, so it was with other nations,
and the list of Italian ordnance given in Tartaglia’s <cite>Art of
Shooting</cite> shows a general resemblance to that of Henri II. The
desire for a maximum of ranging power, and the necessity of
making the smaller pieces long enough to enter the embrasures
of fortifications, and strong enough to fire many more rounds
than those of the largest size, tended to cause an augmentation
in their size and weight; difficulties of transport had an
effect in imposing a limit of weight on the largest guns which
in the case of the smaller pieces did not operate to the same
degree.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the French possessed, from 1550 onwards,
an organized artillery suitable for transport on campaigns.
The six calibres were mounted on wheeled carriages, horse-drawn,
from which they could be fired; they were moved,
muzzles foremost, with their ponderous trails dragging on the
ground in rear.</p>

<p>At that point French artillery remained, or with little
advance beyond it, until the middle of the eighteenth century.
In the Germanic states, on the other hand, important progress
was made: by the end of the sixteenth century shorter pieces,
shell-fire from mortars, and the use of elevated fire for varying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
ranges, had been adopted. But the chief centre of artillery
progress at the end of the sixteenth century was the Low
Countries, then in the thick of their warfare with Spain. “In
their glorious struggle for independence their artillery contrived
to avail itself of the latest and best theory and practice, to
employ cannons and carriages of simplicity and uniformity;
and it has endowed the art of war with two inventions of the
first order—the hand-grenade and the bomb.”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>In the first half of the seventeenth century the genius of
Gustavus Adolphus gave a new value to land ordnance. He
made it mobile. He divided his artillery into two categories,
Siege and Field, and for the latter devised the famous light
“leather guns” which, operating in mass on certain points,
had an important effect on the issue of battles. But after
his death at Lützen in 1632 the effort to attain mobility
relaxed; an increase in the strength of powders at this time
rendered the possibility still more remote; and it was not
until the following century that the Prussians, under Frederick
the Great, evolved a satisfactory light artillery. Both in
Prussia and in Austria great efforts were made, in the middle
of the eighteenth century, to evolve a mobile and efficient
ordnance. The Seven Years’ War found the former state
experimenting with pieces varying in weight between eighty
and a hundred and fifty times the weight of their ball; and in
1762 a certain French observer, who was destined to become
famous as one of the great artillery reformers of all time, wrote
letters from Vienna describing the fine qualities of the Austrian
service: with its pieces all sixteen calibres in length, all 115
times their balls in weight, all bored to their true nominal
dimensions, and firing accurately spherical balls of correct
size, with a small windage and a powder-charge of less than
one-third the weight of the shot.</p>

<p>In the years immediately following the close of the Seven
Years’ War the lessons learned at Vienna were translated into
practice in France. By 1765 Gribeauval had begun his reorganization
of the French material. In order to obtain
mobility he made new models of 12, 8, and 4-pounders, very
plain, unchambered pieces, each eighteen calibres in length,
150 times its own shot in weight, and firing well-fitting balls
with unprecedented precision, with powder-charges of one-third
the weight of the balls. Limbers, in the form of small-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>trucked
bogies, had been in occasional use ever since the
sixteenth century. Gribeauval introduced large-wheeled
limbers, and dragged his 12-pounders by six, his 8- and
4-pounders by four horses. From the number of horses, as
compared with that of the edict of Henri II, one can measure
the progress made in two centuries. The whole of Gribeauval’s
material was designed to afford rapid transport and rapid and
accurate fire; interchangeability of wheels and other parts
formed a novel and important element of the standardization
which he accomplished. Iron axle-trees, cartridges (used
with effect by Gustavus in the preceding century), elevating
screws, tangent scales, and other improvements were adopted
under his authority. But, “Gribeauval could not force on
France the two great inventions of the century—the limber-box
and the Horse Artillery.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p>The horse, or flying, artillery, designed to be attached to,
and supported by, cavalry, as field or foot artillery was attached
to infantry, was a Prussian invention. It was adopted by
France after the outbreak of the Revolution, and almost
simultaneously it appeared in the British army.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>By the end of the century all the great Powers had adopted
Gribeauval’s system in most of its important parts: notably
in the grouping of artillery into the three categories—siege,
field, and coast defence. Progress continued. In the opening
years of the next century a new competitor among the Powers
began to attract attention by its proficiency. “In the first
campaigns of the Revolution the English artillery showed
itself less advanced than that of several other powers. But so
well did it succeed in ameliorating its condition that when it
reappeared on the Continent to take an active part in the
Peninsular War it was seen to be itself worthy in its turn to
serve as a model.”</p>

<p>This is the tribute paid by Colonel Favé.</p>

<p>It is evident from his further remarks that the English
artillery surprised its adversaries, not only by its superior
mobility, but by the effectiveness of its innovations, two of
which, especially, proved to be inventions of the first order—Shrapnel’s
projectiles and Congreve’s war-rockets. France
recognized the high efficiency of its opponent artillery, and
some years later adopted a material embodying some of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
most important features. Experiments were made, and comparative
trials carried out, with modified English and modified
Gribeauval equipments. The former were preferred,
and a new series of designs was introduced and approved:
this becoming known as “the system of 1827.”</p>

<p>Three years later war experience led to investigations in
France which caused a revolution in artillery material. In a
few years’ time smooth-bore cannon were being converted to
rifles, for use both on land and sea.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE STEAM ENGINE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> greatest of the world’s inventions appear to have
had a very casual birth. So much an affair of chance
has been their first manifestation, that science has
not been called in aid; no law can be discerned which might
govern the time and sequence of their coming; they seem to
have been stumbled on, unpedigreed offspring of accident and
time. A monk of Metz discovers gunpowder. “Surely,” says
Fuller, “ingenuity may seem transposed, and to have crossed
her hands, when about the same time a soldier found out
printing.” “It should seem,” writes Lord Bacon, “that
hitherto men are rather beholden to a wild goat for surgery, or
to a nightingale for music, or to the ibis for some part of physic,
or to the pot-lid that flew open for artillery, or generally to
chance, or anything else, than to logic for the invention of the
Arts and Sciences.” So it seemed. And in due time the legend
of the pot-lid was woven round the unfortunate Marquis of
Worcester, who, tradition had it, made the discovery of the
steam engine by observation of the stew-pot in which, when
confined a prisoner in the Tower, he was engaged in cooking his
dinner. At a later date and in another form the story was
connected with James Watt.</p>

<p>In reality, the story of the discovery of the steam engine is
far more inspiring. The history of the application of steam to
human use is almost the history of science itself; the stages of
its development are clearly marked for us; and the large
succession of these stages, and the calibre of the minds which
contributed to the achievement of the perfected steam engine,
are some measure of the essential complexity of what is to-day
regarded as a comparatively simple machine. For the steam
engine was not the gift of any particular genius or generation;
it did not leap from any one man’s brain. Some of the greatest
names in the history of human knowledge can claim a share in
its discovery. From philosopher to scientist, from scientist to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
engineer the grand idea was carried on, gradually taking more
and more concrete form, until finally, in an age when by the
diffusion of knowledge the labours of all three were for the first
time co-ordinated, it was brought to maturity. A new force of
nature was harnessed which wrought a revolution in the
civilized world.</p>

<p>An attempt is made in this chapter to chronicle the circumstances
under which the successive developments of the steam
engine took place. The progress of the scientific ideas which
led up to the discovery of the power of steam is traced. The
claims of the various inventors chiefly associated with the
steam engine are set forth in some detail, not for the difficult
and invidious task of assessing their relative merits, but
because by the light of these claims and altercations it may be
possible to discern, in each case, where the merit lay and to
what stage each novelty of idea or detail properly belonged.
From this point of view, it is thought, the recital of circumstances
which hitherto have been thought so trivial as to be
scarcely worthy of record, may be of some suggestive value.
The result of the investigation is to make clear the scientific
importance of the steam engine: the steam engine regarded,
not as the familiar drudge and commonplace servant of to-day,
but in all its dignity of a thermodynamic machine, that
scientific device which embodied so much of the natural
philosophy of the age which first unveiled it—the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>Before the Christian era steam had been used to do
mechanical work. In a treatise, <cite>Pneumatica</cite>, written by Hero
of Alexandria about 130 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, mention is made of a primitive
reaction turbine, which functioned by the reactionary force of
steam jets thrown off tangentially from the periphery of a
wheel. In the same work another form of heat-engine is
described: an apparatus in which, by the expansion from
heating of air contained in a spherical vessel, water was
expelled from the same vessel to a bucket, where by its weight
it gave motion mysteriously to the doors of temples. And
evidence exists that in these two forms heat engines were used
in later centuries for such trivial purposes as the blowing of
organs and the turning of spits. But except in these two
primitive forms no progress is recorded for seventeen centuries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
after the date of Hero’s book. The story of the evolution of
steam as a motive force really begins, with the story of modern
science itself, at the end of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>With the great revival of learning which took place in
Southern Europe in the latter part of the fifteenth century new
light came to be thrown on the classical philosophies which still
ruled men’s minds, and modern science was born. New views
on natural phenomena began to irradiate, and, sweeping aside
the myths and traditions which surrounded and stifled them,
the votaries of the “new science” began to formulate opinions
of the boldest and most unorthodox description.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> The true
laws of the equilibrium of fluids, discovered originally by
Archimedes, were rediscovered by Stevinus. By the end of
the sixteenth century the nature of the physical universe was
become a pursuit of the wisest men. To Galileo himself was
due, perhaps, the first distinct conception of the power of
steam or any other gas to do mechanical work; for “he, the
Archimedes of his age, first clearly grasped the idea of force as a
mechanical agent, and extended to the external world the conception
of the invariability of the relation between cause and
effect.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> To his brilliant pupil Torricelli the questioning world
was indebted for the experiments which showed the true nature
of the atmosphere, and for the theory he proclaimed that the
atmosphere by its own weight exerted its fluid pressure—a
theory which Pascal soon confirmed by the famous ascent of
his barometer up the Puy-de-Dôme, which demonstrated that
the pressure supporting his column of mercury grew less as the
ascent proceeded. Giovanni della Porta, in a treatise on
pneumatics published in the year 1601, had already made two
suggestions of the first importance. Discussing Hero’s door-opening
apparatus, della Porta showed that steam might be
substituted for air as the expanding medium, and that, by
condensing steam in a closed vessel, water might be sucked up
from a lower level by virtue of the vacuum so formed. And a
few years later, in 1615, Solomon de Caus, a French engineer,
had come to England with a scheme almost identical with della
Porta’s, and actually constructed a plant which forced up
water to a height by means of steam. Shortly afterwards the
“new science” received an accession of interest from the
invention, by Otto von Guericke of Magdeburg, of a suction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
pump by which the atmospheric air could be abstracted from a
closed vessel.</p>

<p>By the middle of this century the learned of all European
countries had been attracted by the knowledge gained of the
material universe. In England the secrets of science were
attacked with enthusiasm under the new strategy of Lord
Bacon, enunciated in his <cite>Novum Organum</cite>. The new philosophy
was patronised by royalty itself, and studied by a company of
brilliant men of whom the leading physicist was Robert Boyle,
soon famous for his law connecting the volumes and the
pressures of gases. In France, too, a great enthusiasm for
science took birth. A group of men, of whom the most
eminent was Christian Huyghens, banded themselves together
to further scientific inquiry into the phenomena of nature and
to demolish the reigning myths and fallacies: they also working
admittedly by the experimental method of Bacon.</p>

<p>The time was ripe, however, for wider recognition of these
scientists and the grand object of their labours. Within a short
time the two groups were both given the charter of their
respective countries; in France they were enrolled as the
Royal Academy of Sciences; in England, as the Royal Society
for Improving Natural Knowledge. In other countries
societies of a similar kind were formed, but their influence was
not comparable with that exerted by the societies of London
and Paris. Between these two a correspondence was started
which afterwards developed into one of the most famous of
publications: the <cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite>. In England,
especially, the Royal Society served from its inception as a
focus for all the great minds of the day, and in time brought
together such men as Newton, Wren, Hooke, Wallis, Boyle—not
to mention his majesty King Charles himself; who, with
the best intentions, could not always take seriously the
speculations of the savants. “Gresham College he mightily
laughed at,” noted Mr. Pepys in his diary for the first of
February, 1663, “for spending time only in weighing of ayre,
and doing nothing else since they sat.” A year later Pepys
was himself admitted a member of the distinguished company,
and found it “a most acceptable thing to hear their discourse,
and see their experiments, which were this day on fire, and how
it goes out in a place where the air is not free, and sooner out in
a place where the ayre is exhausted, which they showed by an
engine on purpose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>In the year 1663, just after the formation of the Royal
Society, a small book was published by the Marquis of
Worcester, <cite>A Century of the Names and Scantlings of such
Inventions as he had tried and perfected</cite>.</p>

<p>Of these inventions one, the sixty-eighth, is thus described:</p>

<p>“An admirable and most forcible way to drive up water
by fire, not by drawing or sucking it upwards, for that must
be as the Philosopher calleth it, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Intra sphæram activitatis</i>,
which is but at such a distance. But this way hath no bounder,
if the vessels be strong enough; for I have taken a piece of a
whole cannon, whereof the end was burst, and filled it three-quarters
full of water, stopping and screwing up the broken
end, as also the touch-hole; and making a constant fire under
it, within twenty-four hours it burst and made a great crack.
So that having a way to make my vessels, so that they are
strengthened by the force within them, and the one to fill after
the other; I have seen the water run like a constant fountain-stream
forty foot high; one vessel of water rarified by fire
driveth up forty of cold water. And a man that tends the
work is but to turn two cocks, that one vessel of water being
consumed, another begins to force and refill with cold water,
and so successfully, the fire being tended and kept constant,
which the selfsame person may likewise abundantly perform
in the interim between the necessity of turning the said cocks.”</p>

<p>On this evidence the claim is made that the marquis was the
original inventor of the steam engine. Is he at all entitled to
the honour? The whole affair is still surrounded with mystery.
It is known that he was an enthusiastic student of physical
science, and that for years he had working for him a Dutch
mechanic, Caspar Kaltoff; it seems certain that he actually
made a water-pumping engine worked by steam, of whose
value he was so impressed that he promised to leave the
drawings of it to Gresham College and intended to have a
model of it buried with him.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> But neither model nor drawings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
has ever yet been traced. And, considering the social influence
of the inventor and the importance of the invention, the silence
of his contemporaries on the discovery is strange and inexplicable.
He received a patent for some form of water-pumping
engine. Distinguished visitors came to Vauxhall to see his
engine at work. He numbered among his acquaintances Sir
Jonas Moore, Sir Samuel Morland, Flamstead and Evelyn:
probably Mr. Pepys, Sir W. Petty, and others of the group of
eminent men of his time who were interested in natural science.
Yet no trace of his inventions has come down to us. His
<cite>Century</cite> was admittedly compiled from memory—“my former
notes being lost”—and perhaps it was designedly obscure;
science was at that time a hobby of the cultured few, and
scientific men loved to mystify each other by the exhibition,
without explanation, of paradoxes and toys of their own construction.
The marquis, it will be agreed, left valuable hints to
later investigators. Whether his claim to have invented the
steam engine is sufficiently substantiated, we leave to the opinion
of the interested reader, who will find most of the evidence on
this subject in Dirck’s <cite>Life of the Marquis of Worcester</cite>.</p>

<p>The power of steam to drive water from a lower to a higher
level had been shown by Solomon de Caus,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> who, in his work,
<cite>Les Raisons des Forces Mouvantes</cite>, published in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1615, had
described a hot-water fountain operated by heating water in
a globe. In Van Etten’s <cite>Récreation Mathematique</cite> of 1629 was
an experiment, described fifty years later by Nathaniel Nye in
his <cite>Art of Gunnery</cite> as a “merry conceit,” showing how the
force of steam could be used to discharge a cannon. As
the century advanced the ornamental was gradually superseded
by the utilitarian; the usefulness of steam for draining
fens, pumping out mines, was realized; and applications for
patents to cover the use of new and carefully guarded inventions
began to appear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
Gunpowder as a medium was a strong competitor of steam.
In 1661 King Charles granted to Sir Samuel Morland, his
master of mechanics, “for the space of fourteen years, to have
the sole making and use of a new invention of a certain engine
lately found out and devised by him, for the raising of water
out of any mines, pits, or other places, to any reasonable
height, and by the force of air and powder conjointly.” What
form the engine took is not known; whether the gunpowder
was used to produce a gaseous pressure by which the work was
done, or whether its function was to displace air and thus
cause a vacuum as its gases cooled. In France, too, efforts
were made at this time to produce a gunpowder engine. In
1678 a Jean de Hautefeuille raised water by gunpowder, but
authorities differ as to whether he employed a piston—which
were then in use as applied to pumps—or whether he
burned the powder so that the gases came in actual contact
with the water. In the following year an important advance
was made. Huyghens constructed an engine having a piston
and cylinder, in which gunpowder was used to form a vacuum,
the atmospheric pressure providing the positive force to
produce motion; and in 1680 he communicated to the
Academy of Sciences a paper entitled, “A new motive power
by means of gunpowder and air.”</p>

<p>But it was to his brilliant pupil, Denis Papin, that we are
indebted for a further step in the materialization of the steam
engine. Papin suggested the use of steam for gunpowder.</p>

<p>In 1680 Papin, who like Solomon de Caus had brought his
scientific conceptions to England in the hope of their furtherance,
was admitted on the recommendation of Boyle to a
fellowship of the Royal Society. After a short absence he
returned to London in ’84 and filled for a time the post of
curator to the society, meeting, doubtless, in that capacity
the leading scientists of the day and coming in touch with all
the practical efforts of English inventors. During his stay
here he worked with enthusiasm at the production of a prime
mover, and when he left in ’87 for a mathematical professorship
in Germany he continued there his researches and experienced
repeated failures. In a paper published in ’88 he showed
a clear conception of a reciprocating engine actuated by
atmospheric pressure, and in ’90 he suggested for the first
time the use of steam for forming the vacuum required. As
water, he wrote, has elasticity when fire has changed it into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
vapour, and as cold will condense it again, it should be possible
to make engines in which, by the use of heat, water would
provide the vacuum which gunpowder had failed to give.
This memorable announcement gave a clear direction to the
future development of the heat engine. Steam was the
medium best suited for utilizing the expansive power of heat
generated by the combustion of fuel; steam was the medium
which, by its expansive and contractile properties, could be
made to impart a movement <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">de va et vient</i> to a piston. Though
Papin did not succeed in putting his idea into practical form
his conception was of great value, and he must be counted
as one of the principal contributors to the early development
of the steam engine. His life was an accumulation of apparent
failures ending in abject poverty. To-day he is honoured
by France as the inventor of the steam engine, and at Blois
a statue has been erected and a street named to his memory.</p>

<p>Before the end of the century an effective engine had been
produced, in England.</p>

<p>In 1698 Thomas Savery, a Devonshire man, obtained a
patent for “a new invention for raising of water and occasioning
motion to all sorts of millwork by the impellent force of
fire.” Before the king at Hampton Court a model of this
invention was displayed, and the importance of the new
discovery was soon realized by the landed classes; for in the
following year an act of parliament was passed for the encouragement
of the inventor and for his protection in the
development of what, it was recognized, was likely to prove
of great use to the public. In the same year Savery published
a pamphlet called <cite>The Miner’s Friend</cite>, and republished it,
with additions, in 1702. This pamphlet contained a full and
clear description of his engine; but significance has been
attached to the omission from it of any claim that it embodied
a new idea. The omission may be accidental.</p>

<p>The steam engine, shown in the accompanying illustration,
was simply a pump, whose cycle of operations was as follows.
Steam, admitted into the top of a closed vessel containing
water and acting directly against the water, forced it through
a pipe to a level higher than the vessel itself. Then, the vessel
being chilled and the steam in it thereby condensed, more
water was sucked into the vessel from a lower level to fill the
vacuum thus formed; this water was expelled by steam in
the same way as before, cocks being manipulated, and, eventually,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
self-acting valves being placed, so as to prevent the
water from returning by the way it came. Two chambers
were used, operating alternately.</p>

<p>For this achievement Savery is by many regarded as the
first and true inventor. He certainly was the first to make
the steam engine a commercial success,
and up and down the country it was
extensively used for pumping water
and for draining mines. By others
Savery was regarded as a copyist; and
indeed it is difficult to say how far
originality should be assigned him.
The marquis too had claimed to raise
water; his engine had evidently acted
with a pair of displacement-chambers,
from each of which alternately water
was forced by steam while the other
vessel was filling. And if he did not
specify or appreciate the effect of the
contractile force of the steam when
condensed, yet in this respect both
inventors had been anticipated by
Giovanni della Porta.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="smaller">Steam from Boiler.</p>

<p>SAVERY’S ENGINE</p></div></div>

<p>The marquis had a violent champion
in Dr. Desaguliers, who in his <cite>Experimental
Philosophy</cite>, published in 1743,
imputed disreputable conduct to the later inventor. “Captain
Savery,” said the doctor, “having read the Marquis of Worcester’s
book, was the first who put into practice the raising
of water by fire. His engine will easily appear to have been
taken from the Marquis of Worcester; though Captain
Savery denied it, and the better to conceal the matter, bought
all the Marquis of Worcester’s books that he could purchase
in Pater-Noster Row and elsewhere, and burned them in the
presence of the gentleman his friend, who told me this. He
said that he found out the power of steam by chance, and
invented the following story to persuade people to believe it,
viz. that having drunk a flask of Florence at a tavern, and
thrown the empty flask upon the fire, he called for a bason
of water to wash his hands, and perceiving that the little wine
left in the flask had filled the flask with steam, he took the
flask by the neck and plunged the mouth of it under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
surface of the water in the bason, and the water in the bason
was immediately driven up into the flask by the pressure of
the air. Now, he never made such an experiment then, nor
designedly afterwards, which I shall thus prove,” etc. etc.</p>

<p>Other writers saw no good reason for depriving the captain
of the title of inventor. With reference to the book-burning
allegation, the only evidence tending to substantiate it lay
in the fact that the book “on a sudden became very scarce,
and but few copies of it were afterwards seen, and then only
in the libraries of the curious.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> It has been remarked, also,
that Desaguliers was himself to some extent a rival claimant,
several improvements, such as the substitution of jet for the
original surface condensation being due to him; and that this
fact gave a palpable bias to his testimony on the work of
others.</p>

<p>In recent years the claims of Savery have been upheld, as
against those of the marquis, by a writer who argued, not
only that the engine of the marquis had never passed the
experimental stage, but that no counter-claim was made by
his successors at the time Savery produced his engine and
obtained his patent. “Although a patent for ninety-nine
years (from 1663 to 1762) was granted the marquis, yet
Captain Savery and his successors under his patents which
extended for thirty-five years (from 1698 to 1733) compelled
every user of Newcomen’s and other steam engines to submit
to the most grinding terms and no one attempted to plead
that Savery’s patents were invalidated by the Marquis of
Worcester’s prior patents.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>By the admirers of Papin it has been claimed that it was
from him that Savery received his idea. “After having
minutely compared Savery’s machine,” says a biographer of
Papin, “one arrives at the conviction that <em>Savery discovered
nothing</em>. He had borrowed from Solomon de Caus the use of
steam as a motive force, perfected by the addition of a second
chamber; from Papin, the condensation of the steam....
And as for the piston, borrowed ten years later by Newcomen,
that was wholly Papin’s.”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>Suppose it true; even so, his countrymen would always
think great credit attaches to Savery for his achievement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
His engine, though used extensively for lifting water through
small distances, was exceedingly wasteful of fuel, nor could it
be used conveniently for pumping out mines or for other
purposes in which a large lift was required. The lift or “head”
was directly proportional to the steam pressure. Efforts to
improve the lift by augmenting the steam pressure resulted
in endless accidents and discouragement; the solder of the
engine melted when steam of a higher pressure was used, the
joints blew open and the chambers burst.</p>

<p>Living at Dartmouth, within some fifteen miles of Savery’s
home, were two men, Newcomen, an ironmonger, and Cawley,
a glazier. These two had, doubtless, every opportunity of
seeing Savery’s engine at work. They appreciated its limitations
and defects, and, undertaking the task of improving it,
they so transformed the steam engine that within a short time
their design had almost entirely superseded the more primitive
form. Here, too, it might be said that they invented nothing.
The merit of their new machine consisted in the achievement
in practical form of ideas which hitherto had had scarcely
more than an academic value. The labours of others gave
them valuable aid. Newcomen, it is certain, could claim considerable
knowledge of science, and though little is known of
his personality there is evidence that he had pursued for years
the object which he now achieved. He knew of the previous
forms of piston engine which had been invented. He had
probably read a translation, published in the <cite>Philosophical
Transactions</cite>, of Papin’s proposal for an atmospheric engine
with a vacuum produced by the condensation of steam. He
obtained from Savery the idea of a separate boiler, and other
details. And where Papin had failed, Newcomen and his
partner succeeded. Their Atmospheric Steam Engine, as it
was aptly called, was produced in the year 1705, and at once
proved its superiority over the old “Miner’s Friend.” It had
assumed an entirely new form. In a large-bore vertical
cylinder a brass piston was fitted, with a leather flap round its
edge and a layer of water standing on it to form a seal against
the passage of steam or air. The top of the cylinder was open
to the atmosphere, the bottom was connected by a pipe with
a spherical boiler. The piston was suspended by a chain to
one end of an overhanging timber beam, which was mounted
on a brick structure so as to be capable of oscillating on a
gudgeon or axis at its middle. One end of this beam was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
vertically over the piston; at the other end was the bucket
of a water-pump, also attached to a crosspiece or “horse-head,”
by means of a chain or rod. The whole machine
formed a huge structure like a pair of scales, one of which (the
water-pump) was loaded with weights so as to be slightly
heavier than the other (the steam engine).</p>

<div id="ip_104" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 17.3125em;">
  <img src="images/i_p104.jpg" width="277" height="293" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">NEWCOMEN’S ENGINE</div></div>

<p>To work it, steam was generated in the boiler at a pressure
slightly greater than atmospheric. By the opening of a cock
steam was admitted to the cylinder, below the piston, which
was initially at rest in its highest position. The steam having
filled the cylinder and expelled nearly all the air, the cock
was shut and the cylinder was chilled by an external spray
of cold water. Whereupon, as soon as the steam in the cylinder
began to condense, the piston, forced down by the now unbalanced
atmospheric pressure above it, began to descend.
As soon as it had completed its downward stroke steam was
again admitted beneath the piston, and, the pressure on the
two sides of the piston becoming equal, the piston began to
move up again to its original position. And so on.</p>

<p>This was the original Newcomen engine. Even in this
primitive form it far surpassed Savery’s in economy of fuel
and in safety. It had, too, far greater flexibility in the manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
in which its power could be applied; it could be used not only
to lift a certain volume of water through a relatively small
height, but a smaller volume through a greater height: which
was a desideratum in the case of deep mines like those of
Cornwall. In 1720 an engine was erected at Wheal Fortune
mine having a cylinder nearly four feet in diameter and
drawing water, at fifteen strokes a minute, from a depth of
180 feet.</p>

<p>Yet it was apparent that the engine was in many respects
inefficient. The cocks, for instance, which controlled the
motion of the piston had to be opened and shut by a man.
Sometimes he let the piston rise too far, in fact, right out of the
cylinder; sometimes he let it down too fast, so as to damage
the engine. Again, the external spraying of the cylinder at
every stroke to induce condensation of the steam within was an
obviously clumsy and primitive operation. It was not long
before external spraying gave place to internal cooling of the
steam by the injection of water; this method being discovered,
it is said, as the result of a leaky piston allowing its sealing
water to pass, yet giving unaccountably good results. The
difficulties with the cocks were overcome by the laziness or
initiative of a youth named Humphrey Potter, who attached
some strings and catches to the cocks of an engine which he
was employed to work at Wolverhampton.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>With these improvements the engine remained practically
without alteration for the next forty years. Its greatest
sphere of usefulness was in the northern coalfields, where cheap
and abundant fuel was close at hand. In Cornwall, until by
special legislation the duty on seaborne coal was remitted when
used for Newcomen’s engine, the cost of fuel proved a great
obstacle to its use.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>In 1764 James Watt, an instrument maker employed on
work for Glasgow College, was given the task of repairing a
working model of a Newcomen engine.</p>

<p>A man of serious and philosophical mind, an intimate friend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
of Professor Robison, the physicist, and acquainted with the
famous Dr. Black of Edinburgh, then in the thick of his
researches on the phenomena of latent heat, Watt often
discussed with these two scientists the possibility of improving
the steam engine; which apparatus was still only employed for
the purpose of pumping water, and which was so clumsy and so
wasteful of fuel as to be comparatively little used. To this end
he was induced to try some experiments on the production and
condensation of steam. The results of these, and a knowledge
of the newly discovered phenomenon of latent heat,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> convinced
him that the existing cycle of operations in the engine
was fundamentally inefficient, and that improvement was to
be sought in the engine itself rather than in the boiler, which
was the element which was receiving most attention from
contemporary investigators.</p>

<p>In particular, he clearly discerned the thermal inefficiency
of the Newcomen engine: the waste of heat involved in alternately
heating and cooling the large metal cylinder, which
absorbed such immense quantities of fuel. Watt’s first idea
was, to lag the cylinder in wood so as to prevent all outward
radiation. But the result of a trial of a lagged cylinder was
disappointing. A gain was certainly obtained in that the
steam, when admitted to the cylinder, did not require to raise
by partial condensation the temperature of the walls; it
exerted its expansive force at once and the piston rose. But on
the other hand much greater difficulty was experienced in condensing
it when a vacuum was required, for the down stroke.
Moreover it was observed that an increase in the amount of
injection water only made matters worse.</p>

<p>Watt was faced with a dilemma, and he overcame it by a
series of studies in the properties of steam which constitute,
perhaps, the highest achievement of this workman-philosopher.</p>

<p>Out of all his experiments two conclusions were drawn by
him; first, that the lower the temperature of condensation of
steam the more perfect the vacuum thereby formed; second,
that the temperature of the cylinder should be as nearly as
possible equal to that of the steam admitted to it. In Newcomen’s
engine these two conditions were obviously incompatible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
and the problem was,—how could they be reconciled?
Early in 1765, while walking one Sunday afternoon in Glasgow
Green the idea flashed upon him of condensing the steam in a
separate vessel. The steam was generated in a separate vessel,
why not produce the vacuum separately? With a view to
trying this effect he placed a hollow air-tight chest beneath the
steam cylinder, connected with it by a pipe having a stop-cock
in it. This new or lower vessel was immersed in a cistern of cold
water. Upon trial being made, it was found that by this simple
contrivance as perfect a vacuum as desired was produced; the
speed of the engine was greatly increased, the expenditure of
fuel radically reduced, the walls of the steam cylinder were
maintained at a high and constant temperature, and the whole
arrangement promised great success. The new vessel Watt
called a Condenser.</p>

<p>Fresh difficulties now arose. As the engine worked, the
condenser gradually filled with the condensed steam and
had to be emptied periodically. The water in which it was
immersed became so hot, by absorbing the heat of the steam,
that it frequently required changing. Watt promptly called in
aid two new auxiliaries, two organs whose motion was derived
from the main beam of the engine: the Air Pump and the
Circulating Pump. By these expedients the action of the
condenser was rendered satisfactory, and an engine resulted
which had a fuel-consumption less than half that of Newcomen’s
engine.</p>

<p>Much, he saw, yet remained to be done to obtain economical
expenditure of steam. In particular the open-topped
cylinder, whose walls were chilled at every descent of the
piston by contact with atmospheric air, was an obvious source
of inefficiency. He therefore determined not to expose the
walls to the atmosphere at all, but to enclose all the space
above the piston; and, thinking thus, he conceived the idea
of replacing the air above the piston by steam, an equally
powerful agent. The cylinder he proposed to maintain at a
constant high temperature by means of a layer of hot steam
with which he encased it, which he called a steam jacket. And
so the atmospheric engine as left by Newcomen evolved into
the <em>single-acting steam engine</em> of Watt;—an engine in which
steam was still used below the piston, only to displace air and
provide a vacuized space for the downward motion of the
piston; but in which steam now acted positively above the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
piston, in lieu of atmospheric air, to drive it down. It was still
a sufficiently primitive form of prime mover. The piston was
still lifted by the counterweight at the other end of the timber
cross-beam; the engine had not yet developed the organs necessary
for producing a satisfactory rotary motion. This step
was shortly to follow.</p>

<p>In 1769 Watt obtained his patent for the “double impulse,”
as it was called; and by this step, by the transition from a
single- to a double-acting engine, the possibilities of such
machines for every variety of application first came into
general view. This stage of the development showed to the
full the ingenuity of Watt’s mechanical mind. By the invention
of the slide-valve he distributed steam to the top and to the
bottom of the cylinder, and in appropriate phase with these
actions opened the two ends to the condenser; so that
the piston was actuated positively and by an equal force on
both up and down strokes. The chain by which the piston had
been suspended was no longer adequate; it was replaced by a
rod. A straight-line motion was required for the top end of the
rod; so he formed a rack, to gear with the circular end
or horse-head of the beam. But this noisy mechanism was
soon superseded by another contrivance, the beautifully
simple “parallel motion,” in which two circular motions are
combined to produce one which is rectilinear. This was
patented in ’84.</p>

<p>Four years before this, that ancient mechanism the crank
and connecting rod had been applied, together with a flywheel,
to transform the reciprocating motion of a steam engine into a
rotary motion; and the non-possession of this invention of
James Pickard’s proved for a time a stumbling-block to Watt
in his further development of his engine. Watt would have
nothing to do with it. By now he had joined his fortunes with
those of Mr. Boulton, of Soho, Birmingham, a man of great
business ability, in conjunction with whom he was engaged in
constructing engines in large numbers to suit the varying
conditions of the mines in Cornwall and the North. Considerable
ingenuity was expended by him in trying to circumvent
the troublesome crank of Pickard, and many devices were
produced, the most noteworthy being the “sun-and-planet
wheels,” which enabled him with some sacrifice of simplicity
to obtain the rotary motion desired.</p>

<p>Watt seemed to be borne along by the momentum of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
own discoveries; every inquiry yielded him valuable reward.
For some time he had studied the possibility of reducing the
violence with which the piston, now positively steam-driven on
both sides, came to the end of its stroke. This problem led
him to the discovery of the advantage of using steam expansively:
of cutting off the inflow of steam before the piston had
travelled more than a fraction of its stroke, and letting its
inherent elastic force impel it through the remainder of its
journey, the steam meanwhile expanding and thus exerting a
continuously decreasing force. Later came the throttle valve,
and the centrifugal governor for controlling the speed of
rotating engines; there was no end to his ingenuity. And so
complete was his inquiry into the possible sources of improvement
of the steam engine, that he even considered means of
regulating the force which the piston exerted on the crank
throughout its working stroke, a force which was compounded
of the steam pressure itself and of the mass-acceleration of the
piston and other moving parts.</p>

<p>Another cardinal invention followed: the Indicator. The
principle of the indicator is now applied to every form and kind
of piston engine. It is a reproduction on a small scale of the
essential part of the engine itself; a small piston, held by a
spring and moving in a cylinder connected by a pipe with the
cylinder of the engine itself, shows by the degree of compression
imparted to the spring the gaseous pressure actually
present at any moment in the engine cylinder. By recording
the position of the indicator piston on a paper wrapped round a
rotating drum whose motion represents the motion of the
engine’s piston, a diagram is obtained which by its area
measures the work done by the steam during the stroke of the
engine.</p>

<p>This instrument was designed by Watt to give his firm some
standard of work which would serve as a basis for the power of
each engine, on which to charge their customers; their engines
being sold by the horse-power. But its usefulness far exceeded
the immediate purpose for which it was produced. Its diagram,
to the eye of an expert, gave valuable information in respect of
the setting of the valves, the tightness of the piston, the dryness
of the steam, the degree of vacuum in the condenser, and,
generally, of the state of efficiency of the engine. “It would be
difficult to exaggerate the part which this little instrument has
played in the evolution of the steam engine. The eminently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
philosophic notion of an indicator diagram is fundamental in
the theory of thermodynamics; the instrument itself is to the
steam engineer what the stethoscope is to the physician, and
more, for with it he not only diagnoses the ailments of a faulty
machine, whether in one or another of its organs, but gauges
its power in health.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>We have now traced the evolution of the steam engine up to
the time when it was first adapted to the propulsion of war-vessels.
There we must leave it. In a later chapter we shall
consider the evolution of the propelling machinery in its
relation, especially, to the military qualities of ships. A few
observations will be sufficient to illustrate the conditions, as to
design, practice, and material, under which the steam engine
made its appearance in the royal navy.</p>

<p>After the death of Watt all improvement of steam machinery
was strenuously opposed by the combined force of prejudice
and vested interest. The great Watt himself had set his face
against the use of high-pressure steam, and, such was the
lingering force of his authority, years passed before the general
public gave assent to the advances made by his talented
successors—Hornblower, Woolf, Evans, and Trevithick. Before
the end of the eighteenth century the first steps had been made
to use the force of steam for driving ships. Before Trafalgar
was fought steam engines had made their appearance in the
royal dockyards. Then there was a pause; and many years
passed by before steam propulsion was admitted to be a
necessity for certain classes of war-vessels.</p>

<p>An interesting account of the state of design and practice
as it existed on ship-board in the year of Queen Victoria’s
accession is given by Commander Robert Otway, R.N., in his
treatise on <cite>Steam Navigation</cite>. Low-pressure principles are still
in vogue; steam is generated still, at a pressure not exceeding
three pounds per square inch, in rectangular boilers of various
forms according to the fancy of the maker, scarcely two being
alike. The engines are also of varying forms, every size,
variety, and power being deemed suitable for similar vessels.
They are amazingly ponderous: weigh about twelve hundredweight,
and the boilers eight hundredweight, to the horsepower.
The engines of all makers exhibit the greatest variations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
in the relative dimensions of their various parts: one
firm embodies a massive frame and light moving rods and
shafts, another adopts massive rods and shafts, and supports
them within the lightest framework. The author advocates a
correct design and a “total dispensation of all superfluous
ornament.”</p>

<div id="ip_111" class="figright" style="max-width: 3.5em;">

  <div class="caption"><p>CONNECTING ROD</p>

<p class="smaller">From Otway</p></div></div>

<p>Already, however, following the example of the
Cornish mines, the builders of steam vessels were at
this time beginning to adopt high-pressure steam,
generated at a pressure of ten to fifteen pounds per
square inch in cylindrical boilers, and working expansively—“doing
work in the cylinder by its
elasticity alone”—before returning to the jet condenser.
This improvement, strenuously opposed by
orthodox engineers as being unsafe for ship practice,
was introduced first into the Packet Establishment
at Falmouth, and then, tardily, into Government
steamers. It gave a gain in economy measured by
the saving of “thousands of bushels of coal per
month.” Steam engines working on the low-pressure
system used from nine to twelve pounds of coal per
hour, for each horse-power. These engines were
carried in vessels “built on the scantling of 10-ton
brigs,” of great draught and of such small coal capacity—about
35 tons, on an average—that when proceeding
out of home waters “they were burthened with, at the
least, four days’ more fuel, <em>on their decks</em> (top hamper), in
addition to that which already filled up their coal-boxes
below.” Boilers emitted black clouds of smoke at sea. In
harbour the paddle-wheels had to be turned daily, if but a few
float-boards only, by the united force of the crew. “Coaling
ship” was carried out with the help of convicts from the
hulks:—“pampered delinquents,” observes the author, “whose
very movements are characteristic of their moral dispositions—being
thieves of time; for their whole day’s duty is not worth
an hour’s purchase.”</p>

<p>In these unattractive circumstances the steam engine, most
wonderful contrivance of the brain and hand of man, presented
itself for embodiment in the navy, by the personnel of which
it was regarded, not without reason, as an unmitigated evil.</p>

successive stages of its evolution. It is now
proposed to give, in the form of a biographical
sketch, an account of the inception of scientific methods as
applied to its use, and at the same time to pay some tribute to
the memory of the man who laid the foundations deep and true
of the science of modern gunnery. One man was destined to
develop, almost unaided, the principles of gunnery as they are
known to-day. This man was a young Quaker of the eighteenth
century, Benjamin Robins.</p>

<p>For a variety of reasons his fame and services seem never to
have been sufficiently recognized or acknowledged by his own
countrymen. To many his name is altogether unknown. To
some it is associated solely with the discovery of the ballistic
pendulum: the ingenious instrument by which, until the
advent of electrical apparatus, the velocities of bullets and
cannon balls could be measured with a high degree of accuracy.
But the ballistic pendulum was, as we shall see, only one
manifestation of his great originating power. The following
notes will show to what a high place Robins attained among
contemporary thinkers; and demonstrate the extent to which,
by happy combination of pure reason and experiment, he
influenced the development of artillery and fire-arms. His
<cite>New Principles of Gunnery</cite> constituted a great discovery,
simple and surprisingly complete. In this work he had not
merely to extend or improve upon the inventive work of
others; his first task was to expose age-long absurdities and
demolish all existing theories; and only then could he replace
them by true principles founded on correct mathematical
reasoning and confirmed by unwearying experiment with a
borrowed cannon or a “good Tower musquet.”</p>

<p>Down to the time of Robins, gunnery was still held to be an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
art and a mystery. The gunner, that honest and godly man,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
learned in arithmetic and astronomy, was master of a terrible
craft;—his saltpetre gathered, it was said, from within vaults,
tombs, and other desolate places;—his touchwood made from
old toadstools dried over a smoky fire;—himself working
unscathed only by grace of St. Barbara, the protectress of all
artillerymen. The efficiency of his practice depended overwhelmingly
on his own knowledge and on the skill with which
he mixed and adjusted his materials. No item in his system
was of sealed pattern; every element varied between the
widest limits. There were no range-tables. His shots varied in
size according to the time they happened to have been in
service, to the degree of rusting and flaking which they had
suffered, and to their initial variations in manufacture. His
piece might be bored taper; if so, and if smaller at the breech
end than at the muzzle, there was a good chance of some shot
being rammed short of the powder, leaving an air space, so that
the gun might burst on discharge; if smaller at the muzzle end
the initial windage would be too great, perhaps, to allow of
efficient discharge of any shot which could be entered. There
was always danger to be apprehended from cracks and flaws.</p>

<p>But the greatest of mysteries was that in which the flight of
projectiles was shrouded. At this point gunnery touched one of
the oldest and one of the main aspects of natural philosophy.</p>

<p>The Greek philosophers failed, we are told, in spite of their
great mental subtlety, to arrive at any true conception of the
laws governing the motion of bodies. It was left to the period
of the revival of learning which followed the Middle Ages to
produce ideas which were in partial conformity with the truth.
Galileo and his contemporaries evolved the theory of the
parabolic motion of falling bodies and confirmed this brilliant
discovery by experiment. Tartaglia sought to apply it to the
motion of balls projected from cannon, but was held up by the
opposing facts: the initial part of the trajectory was seen to be
a straight line in actual practice, and even, perhaps, to have an
upward curvature. So new hypotheses were called in aid, and
the path of projectiles was assumed to consist of three separate
motions: the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">motus violentus</i>, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">motus mixtus</i>, and the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">motus
naturalis</i>. During the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">motus violentus</i> the path of the spherical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
projectile was assumed to be straight—and this fallacy, we
may note in passing, gave rise to the erroneous term “point
blank,” to designate the distance to which the shot would
travel before gravity began to operate; during the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">motus
naturalis</i> the ball was assumed to fall along a steep parabola;
and during the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">motus mixtus</i>, the path of the trajectory near its
summit, the motion was assumed to be a blend of the other
two. This theory, though entirely wrong, fitted in well with
practical observation; the trajectory of a spherical shot was
actually of this form described. But in many respects it had
far-reaching and undesirable consequences. Not only did it
give rise to the misconception of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">point en blanc</i>; it tended
to emphasize the value of heavy charges and high muzzle
velocities while at the same time obscuring other important
considerations affecting range.</p>

<p>So the gunner was primed with a false theory of the trajectory.
But even this could not be relied on as constant in
operation. The ranging of his shot was supposed to be affected
by the nature of the intervening ground; shot were thought to
range short, for some mysterious reason, when fired over water
or across valleys, and the gunner had to correct, as best he
could, for the extra-gravitational attraction which water and
valleys possessed. In addition to all these bewilderments there
was the error produced by the fact that the gun itself was
thicker at the breech than at the muzzle, so that the “line of
metal” sight was not parallel with the bore: a discrepancy
which to the lay mind, and not infrequently to the gunner
himself, was a perpetual stumbling-block.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that, in these conditions, the cannon
remained a singularly inefficient weapon. Imperfectly bored;
discharging a ball of iron or lead whose diameter was so much
less than its own bore that the projectile bounded along it and
issued from the muzzle in a direction often wildly divergent
from that in which the piece had been laid; on land it attained
its effects by virtue of the size of the target attacked, or by use
of the <em>ricochet</em>; at sea it seldom flung its shot at a distant ship,
except for the purpose of dismasting, but, aided by tactics,
dealt its powerful blows at close quarters, double-shotted and
charged lavishly, with terrible effect. It was then that it was
most efficient.</p>

<p>Nor is it surprising that, in an atmosphere of ignorance as
to the true principles governing the combustion of gunpowder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
and the motion of projectiles, false “systems” flourished. The
records of actual firing results were almost non-existent.
Practitioners and mathematicians, searching for the law which
would give the true trajectories of cannon balls, found that the
results of their own experience would not square with any tried
combination of mathematical curves. They either gave up the
search for a solution, or pretended a knowledge which they
were unwilling to reveal.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>In the year 1707 Robins was born at Bath. Studious and
delicate in childhood, he gave early proof of an unusual mathematical
ability, and the advice of influential friends who had
seen a display of his talents soon confirmed his careful parents
in the choice of a profession for him: the teaching of
mathematics. Little, indeed, did the devout Quaker couple
dream, when the young Benjamin took coach for London with
this object in view, that their son was destined soon to be the
first artillerist in Europe.</p>

<p>That the choice of a profession was a wise one soon became
evident. He was persuaded to study the great scientific writers
of all ages—Archimedes, Huyghens, Slusius, Sir James Gregory
and Sir Isaac Newton; and these, says his biographer, he
readily understood without any assistance. His advance was
extraordinarily rapid. When only fifteen years old he aimed
so high as to confute the redoubtable John Bernouilli on the
collision of bodies. His friends were already the leading
mathematicians of the day, and there were many who took a
strong interest in the brilliant and attractive lad. He certainly
was gifted with qualities making for success; for, we are told,
“besides his acquaintance with divers parts of learning, there
was in him, to an ingenuous aspect, joined an activity of
temper, together with a great facility in expressing his thoughts
with clearness, brevity, strength, and elegance.”</p>

<p>Robins’ mind was of too practical a bent, however, to allow him
to stay faithful to pure mathematics; his restless energy required
another outlet. Hence he was led to consider those “mechanic
arts” that depended on mathematical principles: bridge
building, the construction of mills, the draining of fens and the
making of harbours. After a while, taking up the controversial
pen again, he wrote and published papers by which a great
reputation gradually accrued. In 1735 he blew to pieces, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
a <cite>Discourse on Sir Isaac Newton’s Method of Fluxions</cite>, a treatise
written against the mathematicians by the Bishop of Cloyne.
And shortly after followed further abstruse and controversial
studies: on M. Euler’s Treatise on Motion, on Dr. Smith’s
System of Optics, and on Dr. Jurin’s Distinct and Indistinct
Vision.</p>

<p>His command of language now attracted the attention of
certain influential gentlemen who, deploring the waste of such
talent on mathematical subjects, persuaded their young
acquaintance to try his hand at the writing of political
pamphlets: party politics being at that time the absorbing
occupation of the population of these islands. His success was
great; his writings were much admired. And—significant of
the country and the age—friendships and acquaintances were
formed by the pamphleteer which were later to be of great
value to the rising scientist.</p>

<p>This phase of his activities, fortunately, did not last long.
Kindling the lamp of science once more, he now started on the
quest which was to make him famous.</p>

<p>For thoughtful men of all ages, as we have already noted,
the flight of bodies through air had had an absorbing interest.
The subject was one of perennial disputation. The vagaries
of projectiles, the laws governing the discharge of balls from
cannon, could not fail to arouse the curiosity of an enthusiast
like Robins, and he now set himself in earnest to discover
them by an examination of existing data, by pure reason,
and by actual experiment. Perusal of such books as had been
written on the subject soon convinced him of the shallowness
of existing theories. Of the English authors scarcely any two
agreed with one another, and all of them carped at Tartaglia,
the Italian scientist who in the classic book of the sixteenth
century tried to uphold Galileo’s theory of parabolic motion
as applied to military projectiles. But what struck Robins
most forcibly about all their writings was the almost entire
absence of trial and experiment by which to confirm their
dogmatical assertions. This absence of any appeal to experiment
was certainly not confined to treatises on gunnery; it
was a conspicuous feature of most of the classical attempts
to advance the knowledge of physical science. Yet the flight
of projectiles was a problem which lent itself with ease to that
inductive method of discovering its laws through a careful
accumulation of facts. This work had not been done. Of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
the native writers upon gunnery only four had ventured out
of two dimensions; only four had troubled to measure definite
ranges. All four asserted the general proposition that the
motion of bodies was parabolic. Only one noticed that
practice did not support this theory, and he, with misapplied
ingenuity, called in aid the traditional hypothesis of a violent,
a crooked, and a natural motion. Which wrong hypothesis
enabled him, since he could choose for himself the point at
which the straight motion ceased, to square all his results
with his precious theory.</p>

<p>Leaving the books of the practitioners, Robins had more to
learn from the great circle of mathematicians who in the first
part of the eighteenth century lent a lustre to European
science. The old hypotheses were fast being discarded by
them. Newton, in his <cite>Principia</cite>, had investigated the laws of
resistance of bodies to motion through the air under gravity,
by dropping balls from the cupola of St. Paul’s Cathedral;
and he believed that the trajectory of a cannon ball differed
from the parabola by but a small extent. The problem was
at this time under general discussion on the Continent; and
led to a collision between the English and the German mathematicians,
Newton and Leibnitz being the two protagonists.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>
But, whatever the merits or outcome of the controversy, one
thing seems certain. None of the great men of the day understood
the very great accession of resistance which a fast-travelling
body encountered in cleaving the air, or realized the
extent to which the trajectory was affected by this opposing
force. It was in fact universally believed and stated, that
“<em>in the case of large shot of metal, whose weight many times
surpasses that of air, and whose force is very great, the resistance
of air is scarcely discernible, and as such may, in all computations
concerning the ranges of great and weighty bombs, be very safely
neglected</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>In 1743 Robins’ <cite>New Principles of Gunnery</cite> was read before
the Royal Society.</p>

<p>In a short but comprehensive paper which dealt with both
internal and external ballistics, with the operation of the
propellant in the gun and with the subsequent flight of the
projectile, the author enunciated a series of propositions which,
founded on known laws of physics and sustained by actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
experiment, reduced to simple and calculable phenomena the
mysteries and anomalies of the art of shooting with great guns.
He showed the nature of the combustion of gunpowder, and
how to measure the force of the elastic fluid derived from it.
He showed, by a curve drawn with the gun axis as a base,
the variation of pressure in the gun as the fluid expanded,
and the work done on the ball thereby. Producing his ballistic
pendulum he showed how, by firing a bullet of known weight
into a pendulum of known weight, the velocity of impact
could be directly ascertained. This was obviously a very
important discovery. For an accurate measurement of the
“muzzle velocity” of the bullet discharged from any given
piece of ordnance was, and still is, the solution and key to
many another problem in connection with it: for instance,
the effect of such variable factors as the charge, the windage
or the length of gun. In fact, as the author claimed, there
followed from the theory thus set out a whole host of deductions
of the greatest consequence to the world’s knowledge of
gunnery. Then, following the projected bullet in its flight,
he proceeded to tell of the continuous retardation to which it
was subject owing to the air’s resistance. He found, he said,
that this resistance was vastly greater than had been anticipated.
It certainly was not a negligible quantity. The resistance
of the air to a twenty-four pound cannon ball, fired with
its battering charge of sixteen pounds of powder, was no less
than twenty-four times the weight of the ball when it first
issued from the piece: a force which sufficiently confuted the
theory that the trajectory was a parabola, as it would have
been if the shot were fired in vacuo. It was neither a parabola,
nor nearly a parabola. In truth it was not a plane curve at
all. For under the great force of the air’s resistance, added to
that of gravity, a ball (he explained) has frequently a double
curvature. Instead of travelling in one vertical plane it
actually takes an incurvated line sometimes to right, sometimes
to left, of the original plane of departure. And the cause of
this departure he ascribed to a whirling motion acquired by
the ball about an axis during its passage through the gun.</p>

<p>The reading of the paper provoked considerable discussion
among the learned Fellows, who found themselves presented
with a series of the most novel and unorthodox assertions,
not in the form of speculations, but as exact solutions to
problems which had been hitherto unsolved; and these were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
presented in the clearest language and were fortified by experiments
so careful and so consistent in their results as to
leave small room for doubt as to the certainty of the author’s
theory. Of special interest both to savants and artillerists
must have been his account of “a most extraordinary and
astonishing increase in the resistance of the air which occurs
when the velocity comes to be that of between eleven and
twelve hundred feet in one second of time”: a velocity, as
he observed, which is equal to that at which sounds are
propagated in air. He suggested that perhaps the air, not
making its vibrations with sufficient speed to return immediately
to the space left in the rear of the ball, left a vacuum
behind it which augmented the resistance to its flight. His
statement on the deflection of balls, too, excited much comment.
And, in order to convince his friends of the reality of this
phenomenon, which, though Sir Isaac Newton had himself taken
note of it in the case of tennis balls, had never been thoroughly
investigated, Robins arranged an ocular demonstration.</p>

<p>One summer afternoon the experiments took place in a
shady grove in the Charterhouse garden. Screens—“of finest
tissue paper”—were set up at intervals of fifty feet, and a
common musket bored for an ounce ball was firmly fixed in a
vice so as to fire through the screens. By repeated discharges
the various deflections from the original plane of departure
were clearly shown; some of the balls whirled to the right, some
to the left of the vertical plane in which the musket lay. But
not only was the fact of this deflection established to the satisfaction
of the visitors. A simple but dramatic proof was
afforded them of the correctness of Robins’ surmise that the
cause was the whirling of the ball in flight. A musket-barrel
was bent so that its last three or four inches pointed to the
left of the original plane of flight. The ball when fired would
then be expected to be thrown to the left of the original plane.
But, said Robins, since in passing through the bent part
the ball would be forced to roll upon the right-hand side of
the barrel; and as thereby the left side of the ball would
turn up against the air, and would increase the resistance on
that side; then, notwithstanding the bend of the piece to the
left, the bullet itself might incurvate towards the right. “And
this, upon trial, did most remarkably happen.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
Robins by now had gained a European reputation. Mathematical
controversy and experiments in gunnery continued to
occupy his time and absorb his energies, and it was not long
before he was again at the rostrum of the Royal Society,
uttering his eloquent prediction as to the future of rifled
guns. Speaking with all the emphasis at his command he
urged on his hearers the importance of applying rifling not
only to fire-arms but to heavy ordnance. That State, he said,
which first comprehended the advantages of rifled pieces;
which first facilitated their construction and armed its armies
with them; would by them acquire a superiority which would
perhaps fall little short of the wonderful effects formerly produced
by the first appearance of fire-arms. His words had
little or no effect. Mechanical science was not then equal
to the task. A whole century was to elapse before rifled
ordnance came into general use. The genius of Whitworth
was required to enable the workshops of the world to cope
with its refined construction.</p>

<p>Another subject which attracted Robins’ attention at this
time was fortification, the sister art of gunnery, which now
had a vogue as a result of the great continental wars. He was
evidently regarded as an authority on the subject, for we find
him, in 1747, invited by the Prince of Orange to assist in the
defence of Berghen-op-Zoom, then invested and shortly afterwards
taken by the French.</p>

<p>Now befell an incident which, besides being a testimony
to the versatility of his genius, proved to be of great consequence
to him in his study of artillery. In 1740 Mr. Anson
(by this time Lord Anson, and at the head of the Admiralty)
had set out on his famous voyage to circumnavigate the
world. For some time after his return the public had looked
forward to an authentic account, on the writing of which the
chaplain of the <i>Centurion</i>, Mr. Richard Walter, was known to
be engaged. Mr. Walter had collected, in the form of a journal,
a mass of material in connection with the incidents of the
voyage. But on a review of this it was decided that the whole
should be rewritten in narrative form by a writer of repute.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
Robins was approached, and accepted the commission. The
material of the chaplain’s journal was worked up by him into
a narrative, and the book was published in 1748. “It was
an immediate success; four large editions were sold in less
than a year; and it was translated, with its stirring accounts
of perils and successes, into nearly all the languages in Europe.”
Robins’ name did not appear in it, and his share in the authorship
is to this day a subject of literary discussion.</p>

<p>The acquaintance with Lord Anson thus formed was of
great benefit to him, not only in securing for him the means
of varied experiment with all types of guns in use in the royal
navy, but by the encouragement which his lordship gave him
to publish his opinions even when they were in conflict with
the orthodox professional opinion of the day. To this encouragement
was due the publication in 1747 of a pamphlet
entitled, <cite>A Proposal for increasing the strength of the British
Navy, by changing all guns from 18-pounders downwards into
others of equal weight but of a greater bore</cite>; a paper which, indirectly,
had considerable influence on the development of
sea ordnance. In the introduction to this paper the author
explains that its subject-matter is the result of the speculations
and experiments of earlier years; and he describes the
incident which at the later date induced its publication. It
appears that at the capture of the <i>Mars</i>, man-of-war, a manuscript
was discovered on board which contained the results
and conclusions of some important gunnery trials which the
French had been carrying out. This manuscript, being shown
to Robins by Lord Anson, was found to contain strong confirmation
of his own views both as to the best proportions of
guns and the most efficient powder-charges for the same.
He had not published these before, he plaintively explains,
because, “not being regularly initiated into the profession of
artillery, he would be considered a visionary speculatist.”
But fortified by the French MS. he no longer hesitated to
submit his proposal to the public.</p>

<p>Briefly, the paper is an argument for a more efficient
disposition of metal in ordnance. Robins states his case in
language simple and concise. Large shot, he says, have
naturally great advantages in ranging power over small shot;
in sea fighting the size of the hole they make and their increased
power of penetration gives them a greatly enhanced value.
Hence the endeavour made in all cases to arm a vessel with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
largest cannon she can with safety bear. And hence the
necessity for so disposing the weight of metal in a ship’s
ordnance to the best advantage; all metal not usefully
employed in contributing to the strength of the pieces being
not only useless but prejudicial to efficiency.</p>

<p>He then proceeds to prove (not very convincingly, it must be
admitted) that there is a law of comparison to which the
dimensions of all guns should conform, and by which their
weights could be calculated. For every pound of bullet there
should be allowed a certain weight of metal for the gun. So,
taking the service 32-pounder as having the correct proportions,
the weight and size of every other piece can be found from this
standard. He observes, however, that in actual practice the
smaller the gun, the greater its relative weight; the 6-pounder,
for example, weighs at least eighteen hundredweight, when by
the rule it should weigh ten. The proposal is therefore to utilize
the redundant weight of metal by increasing the calibre of the
smaller guns. At the same time it is proposed to limit the
stress imposed on all guns by reducing the powder-charge to
one-third the weight of the bullet, for all calibres; this smaller
charge being almost as efficient for ranging as the larger
charges used, and infinitely less dangerous to the gun.</p>

<p>The publication of the pamphlet came at an opportune
moment. A new spirit was dawning in the navy, a new
enthusiasm and search for efficiency were abroad, which in the
next half-century were to be rewarded by a succession of well-earned
and decisive victories. Interest in the proposed change
in armament was widespread, both in and outside the royal
service. And a significant commentary on the proposed
regulation of powder-charges was supplied, this very year, by
Admiral Hawke, who reported that in the fight off Ushant all
the breechings of his lower-deck guns broke with the repeated
violence of recoil, obliging him to shoot ahead of his opponent
while new breechings were being seized.</p>

<p>Some time was to elapse before the arguments of Robins
gave signs of bearing fruit. Experiments carried out at Woolwich
in the seventies by Dr. Hutton with all the facilities
ensured by the patronage of a ducal master-general of ordnance
merely extended and confirmed Robins’ own results. In ’79
the carronade made its appearance, to attest in dramatic
fashion the value, at any rate for defensive work, of a large
ball, a small charge, and an unusually small windage. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
offensive armament it represented, of course, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">reductio ad
absurdum</i> of the principles enunciated by Robins; its dominant
feature of a ball of maximum volume projected with a minimum
velocity was, in the words of an American authority,
“manifestly as great an error as the minima masses and the
maxima velocities of the long gun system, to which the
carronade was thus directly opposed.” Nevertheless, the
carronade (whose history we deal with in a later chapter) did
excellent work. Mounted upon the upper decks and forecastles
of merchantmen and the smaller classes of warships, it emphasized,
by the powerful and often unexpected blows which it
planted in the ribs of such adversaries as ventured within its
range, the comparative inefficiency of the smaller types of long
gun with which our ships of war were armed. To the clearest-sighted
of our naval captains the relative merits and defects
of the carronade and the small long gun were evidently
clear. In the year 1780 we find Kempenfelt advocating,
in a letter to Sir Charles Middleton, a weapon with
a little more length and weight than a carronade: something
between it and a long gun. Robins’ arguments against
the still prevalent types of small pieces have proved convincing
to him, and he transcribes the whole of the <cite>Proposal</cite> for the
consideration of his superior. “Here you have, sir,” he writes,
“the opinion of the ablest artillery officer in England at that
time, and perhaps in Europe.”</p>

<p>Once more the versatile and gifted pen was called in aid of
politics. In 1749 he was persuaded to write what his biographer
describes as a masterpiece of its kind: <cite>An apology for the
unfortunate affair at Preston-Pans in Scotland</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> But soon an
opening worthier of his talents presented itself. The East
India Company, whose forts in India were as yet ill-adapted
for defence, required the services of an expert in military
fortification. An offer was made, and, as Engineer-General to
the Company, Robins left England for the East at the end of
’49, to the great sorrow of all his acquaintance. They were
not to see him again. In the summer of the following year he
died of a fever, pen in hand, at work upon his plans in the
service of the Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>So ended a short, a brilliant, and a very honourable career.
Benjamin Robins possessed in an exceptional degree the
power, inherent in so many of his countrymen, of applying
the truths of science to practical ends. An individualist
deriving inspiration from the great masters of the past, he
followed the bent of his enthusiasms in whatever direction it
might lead him, till ultimately his talents found expression in
a field undreamed of by himself or by his early friends. In
the realm of gunnery he was an amateur of genius. Partly
for that reason, perhaps, his views do not appear to have been
considered as authoritative by our own professionals; the
prophet had more honour in Berlin, Paris and Washington.
Speaking of the rifle, the true principle of which was admittedly
established by him, the American artillerist Dahlgren wrote in
1856: “The surprizing neglect which seemed to attend his
labours was in nothing more conspicuous than in the history
of this weapon. Now that whole armies are to wield the rifled
musket with its conical shot, one is surprized at the time which
was permitted to elapse since that able experimenter so
memorably expressed his convictions before the Royal Society,
in 1746.”</p>

<p>Of the value of his work to the nation there is now no doubt.
Of the man himself an entertaining picture is given in his
biography, published, together with his principal papers, by
Dr. Hutton, from which many of the foregoing notes have been
taken. Among other eminent men who have given their life and
labours to the public service, and whose efforts in building up
the past greatness of England have been generously acknowledged,
let us not forget to honour that distinguished civilian,

<span class="subhead">THE CARRONADE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">At</span> the monthly meeting of the Carron Company, a
Scotch iron-founding and shipping firm, which was
held in December, 1778, the manager informed the
board that, in order to provide armament for some of the
Company’s sailing packets, he had constructed a very light
species of gun, resembling a cohorn, which was much approved
by many people who had come on purpose to inspect it. So
favourable, indeed, was the impression given by the inspection
of this weapon that, with the company’s permission, he could
receive a great many orders for them. Whereon it was resolved
to authorize the manufacture of the new species in quantity;
and to call all such guns as should be made by them of this
nature, Carronades.</p>

<p>Such were the circumstances in which the carronade first
came into use. And the following advertisement, appearing in
Edinburgh shortly afterwards, sufficiently explains the
incentive for exploiting the new type of ordnance, and the
reason of its popularity among shipowners, passengers and
crews. “To sail March 5, 1779, the <i>Glasgow</i>, Robert Paterson
master, mounting fourteen twelve-pounders, and men answerable....
N.B.—The Carron vessels are fitted out in the
most complete manner for defence at a very considerable
expense, and are well provided with small arms. All mariners,
recruiting parties, soldiers upon furlow, and all other steerage
passengers who have been accustomed to the use of fire-arms,
and who will engage in defending themselves, will be accommodated
with their passage to and from London, upon satisfying
the masters for their provisions, which in no instance
shall exceed 10s. 6d. sterling. The Carron vessels sail regularly
as usual, without waiting for the convoy.”</p>

<p>The carronade was a very short, light, carriage gun of
relatively large bore, made to take a standard size of long-gun
shot and project it, by means of a small charge of powder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
against an enemy at close range. Its proprietors soon found a
market for the produce of their foundry, not only for merchant
ships but for men-of-war. The reputation of the new ordnance
quickly spread; carronades found a place almost immediately
among the orthodox armament of the greater number of our
fighting ships; and kept their place till, after a chequered
career of half a century, during which they contributed both to
victory and to defeat, they were finally discarded from the sea
service.</p>

<p>The story of the carronade begins some little time before the
meeting of the Carron board in the year 1778. It will be
remembered that in 1747 Mr. Benjamin Robins had advocated,
in a much-talked-of paper, an increase in the calibre of warships’
guns at the expense of their ranging power, and that in
support of his argument he had drawn attention to two features
of ship actions—first, that the great majority of duels were
fought at close quarters; secondly, that the destructive effect
of a cannon-ball against an enemy’s hull depended largely on
the external dimensions of the ball, the larger of two balls
producing an effect altogether out of proportion to the mere
difference in size.</p>

<p>However invalid may have been the arguments founded on
these assertions—and that there was a serious flaw in them
time was to show—there could be no doubt that, so far as
considerations of defence were concerned, the conclusions
reached were of important value. In the case of a merchant
packet defending herself from boarding by a privateer, for
example, a light, short-ranging gun throwing a large ball
would give far more effective protection than a small-calibre
long gun. And if, moreover, the former involved a dead
weight less than a quarter, and a personnel less than half, of
that involved by the latter, the consideration of its superiority
in action was strongly reinforced, in the opinion of shipowners
and masters, by less advertised considerations of weight,
space, and equipment—very important in their relation to the
speed and convenience of the vessel, and hence to all concerned.</p>

<p>So the arguments of Robins, though propounded solely with
reference to warships, yet applied with special force to the
defensive armament of merchant ships. A conception of this
fact led a very able artillerist, General Robert Melville, to
propose, in 1774, a short eight-inch gun weighing only thirty-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>one
hundredweight yet firing a nicely fitting sixty-eight pound
ball with a charge of only five and a half pounds of powder.
This piece he induced the Carron company to cast, appropriately
naming it a Smasher. Of all the carronades the Smasher
was the prototype. It possessed the special attributes of the
carronades in the superlative degree; the carronade was a
reproduction, to a convenient scale, of the Smasher. That
General Melville was the prime inventor of the new type, has
been placed beyond doubt by the inscription on a model subsequently
presented to him by the Carron Company. The
inscription runs: “Gift of the Carron Company to Lieut.-General
Melville, inventor of the Smashers and lesser carronades
for solid, ship, shell, and carcass shot, etc. First used against
French ships in 1779.”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>In almost every respect the Smasher was the antithesis of
the long gun: the advantages of the one were founded on the
shortcomings of the other. For instance, the smallness of the
long gun’s ball was a feature which, as ships’ sides came to be
made stronger and thicker, rendered the smaller calibres of
long guns of a diminishing value as offensive armament. It
was becoming increasingly difficult to sink a ship by gunfire.
The round hole made near the enemy’s water-line was insufficient
in size to have a decisive effect; the fibres of the
timber closed round the entering shot and, swelled by sea-water,
half closed the hole, leaving the carpenter an easy task
to plug the inboard end of it. The large and irregular hole made
by a Smasher, on the other hand, the ragged and splintered
opening caused by the crashing of the large ball against the
frames and timbers, was quite likely to be the cause of a
foundering. Again, the high velocity of the long gun’s ball,
while giving it range and considerable penetrative power, was
actually a disadvantage when at close quarters with an enemy.
The maximum effect was gained, as every gunner knew, when
the ball had just sufficient momentum to enable it to penetrate
an opponent’s timbers. The result of a high velocity was often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
to make a clean hole through a ship without making a splinter
or causing her to heel at all. Hence the practice of double-shotting:
a system of two units which, as we have just seen,
was less likely to prove effective than a system of a larger
single unit. On the other hand the Smasher vaunted its low
muzzle velocity. As for the relative powder charges, that of
the long gun was wastefully large and inefficient, while that
of the Smasher was small and very effective. It was in this
respect, perhaps, that the Smasher showed itself to the greatest
advantage. And as this feature exerted from the first an
important influence on all other types of ordnance, we will
examine in some detail the means by which its high efficiency
was attained.</p>

<p>Apart from the inefficiency inherent in the small-ball-and-big-velocity
system the long gun laboured under mechanical
disadvantages from which its squat competitor was happily
free. In the eighteenth century the state of workshop practice
was so primitive as to render impossible any fine measurements
of material. Until the time of Whitworth the true
plane surface, the true cylinder and the true sphere were unattainable
in practice. For this reason a considerable clearance
had to be provided between round shot and the bores of the
guns for which they were intended; in other words, the inaccuracies
which existed in the dimensions of guns and shots
necessitated the provision of a certain “windage.” But other
considerations had also to be taken into account. The varying
temperatures at which shot might require to be used; the
fouling of gun-bores by burnt powder; the effect of wear and
rust on both shot and bore, and especially the effect of rust on
the shot carried in ships of war (at first enlarged by the rust
and then, the rust flaking or being beaten off with hammers,
reduced in size)—all these factors combined to exact such
disproportionate windage that, in the best conditions, from
one-quarter to one-third of the force of the powder was altogether
lost, while, in the worst conditions, as much as one-half
of the propulsive force of the powder escaped unused.
Not only was a large charge required, therefore, but the range
and aim of the loosely fitting shot was often incorrect and
incalculable; the motion of the shot was detrimental to the
surface of the bore and the life of the gun; while the recoil
was so boisterous as sometimes to dismount and disable the
gun, injure the crew, and even endanger the vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
The inventor of the Smasher, by eliminating this obvious
deficiency of the long gun, gave to his weapon not only a
direct advantage due to the higher efficiency of the powder-charge,
but also several collateral advantages arising from it,
such as, economy of powder, ease of recoil, and small stresses
upon the mounting and its supporting structure.</p>

<p>It had been laid down by Dr. Hutton in 1775, as one of the
chief results of the systematic experiments carried out by him
at Woolwich in extension of the inquiries originated by Robins,
that if only the windage of guns could be reduced very important
advantages would accrue; among others, a saving of
at least one-third of the standard charges of powder would
result. General Melville determined to give the Smasher the
very minimum of windage necessary to prevent accident. The
shortness of the bore favoured such a reduction. The large
diameter, though at first it might appear to render necessary
a correspondingly large windage, was actually an advantage
from this point of view. For, instead of adhering to the
orthodox practice with long guns, of making the windage
roughly proportional to the diameter of the bore, he gave the
Smasher a windage less than that of a much smaller long gun,
arguing that though a certain mechanical clearance was
necessary, yet the amount of this clearance was in no way
dependent on the diameter of the shot or piece. The large
size of the Smasher acted therefore to its advantage. The
windage space through which the powder gases could escape
was very small in relation to the area of the large ball on
which they did useful work.</p>

<p>But this divergence from the standard practice would appear
to necessitate the provision of special ammunition for use
with the Smasher: the nicely fitting sixty-eight pound ball
would require to be specially made for it? And this would
surely militate against the general adoption of the Smasher
in the public service? No such difficulty confronted the
inventor. For, curiously enough, the principle on which the
dimensions of gun-bores and shot were fixed was the reverse
of the principle which obtains to-day. Instead of the diameter
of the <em>gun</em> being of the nominal dimension and the diameter
of the shot being equal to that of the gun minus the windage,
the diameter of the <em>shot</em> was the datum from which the amount
of the windage and the calibre of the gun were determined.</p>

<p>So, the size of the shot being fixed, a reduction of windage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
was obtainable in a new design of gun by boring it to a smaller
than the standard diameter. And this was what the inventor
of the Smasher did. The large ball, in combination with the
restricted windage and the small charge of powder, gave the
Smasher ballistic results far superior, relatively, to those
obtained with the long gun. Its lack of ranging power was
admitted. But for close action it was claimed that it would
prove an invaluable weapon, especially in the defence of
merchant ships.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> Not only would its large ball make such
holes in the light hull of an enemy privateer as would break
through his beams and frames and perhaps send all hands to
the pumps; but, projected with just sufficient velocity to
carry it through an opponent’s timbers, it would thereby
produce a maximum of splintering effect and put out of action
guns, their crews, and perhaps the vessel itself.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>On the lines of the Smasher the “lesser carronades,” more
convenient in size and more easily worked, were cast, and
quickly made a reputation in merchant shipping. The
Smasher itself was offered to the admiralty, but was never
fitted in a royal ship; though trials were carried out with it
later with hollow or cored shot, to ascertain how these
lighter balls compared in action with the solid 68-pounders.
Meanwhile the Carron Company found a large market for
the lighter patterns of carronade; the 24, 18, and 12-pounders
were sold in large numbers to private ships and
letters-of-marque, and to some of the frigates and smaller
ships of the royal navy. The progress of the new ordnance
was watched with interest by the board of admiralty. In 1779
we have Sir Charles Douglas writing to Sir Charles Middleton
in full accord with his views on the desirability of mounting
Carron 12-pounders on the poop of the <i>Duke</i>, and suggesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
24-pounders, three a side, upon her quarter-deck. To the same
distinguished correspondent Captain Kempenfelt writes, deploring
that no trials have yet been made with carronades.
Shortly afterwards the navy board discusses the 68-pound
Smasher and desires the master-general of ordnance to make
experiment with it. A scale is drawn up by the navy board,
moreover, and sanctioned by the admiralty, for arming
different rates with 18-and 12-pounder carronades. The
larger classes of ships, the first, second, and third rates, have
their quarter-decks already filled with guns; but accommodation
is found for a couple of carronades on the forecastles, and
for half a dozen on the poop, which for nearly a century past
has served chiefly as a roof for the captain’s cabin. This is
now timbered up and given three pairs of ports, making a
total of eight ports for the reception of carronades. In the case
of smaller ships less difficulty is experienced. Ports are
readily cut in their forecastles and quarter-decks, and in
some cases their poops are barricaded, to give accommodation
for from four to a dozen carronades.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>The new weapon found its way into most of our smaller
ships, not always and solely as an addition to the existing
long-gun armament, for use in special circumstances, but in
many cases in lieu of the long guns of the establishment. The
saving in weight and space gained by this substitution made
the carronade especially popular in the smaller classes of frigate,
the sloops, and brigs; many of which became almost entirely
armed with the type. The weak feature of the carronade, which
in the end was to prove fatal to it—its feeble range and penetrating
power—was generally overlooked, or accepted as being
more than compensated for by its many obvious advantages.
The carronade, it was said by many, was the weapon specially
suited to the favourite tactics of the British navy—a yard-arm
action.</p>

<p>There were others, however, who were inclined to emphasize
the disability under which the carronade would lie if the enemy
could contrive to avoid closing and keep just out of range.
And on this topic, the relative merits of long gun and carronade
as armament for the smaller ships, discussion among naval
men was frequent and emphatic. The king’s service was
divided into two schools. The advocates of long guns could
quote many a case where, especially in chase, the superior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
range of the long gun had helped to win the day. The advocates
of the carronade replied with recent and conclusive
examples of victories won by short-gun ships which had been
able to get to grips and quickly neutralize the advantages of a
superior enemy armed with long guns. When challenged with
the argument that, since the advantages of the carronade
entirely disappear at long ranges it is essential that ships armed
with them should be exceptionally fast sailers, they replied,
that the very lightness of a carronade armament would, other
things being equal, give ships so armed the property required.
As for out-ranging, they were even ready to back their
carronades in that respect, if only they were well charged with
powder. It was a matter of faith with many that, in spite of
Dr. Hutton’s published proof to the contrary, a considerable
increase of range could be obtained by the expedient of
shortening the gun’s recoil; so that in chase it was a common
procedure to lash the breechings of carronades to the ship’s
timbers, to prevent recoil and to help the shot upon its way.</p>

<p>At first mechanical difficulties occurred in the fitting of the
new carronade mountings which, though not due to any
defect inherent in the equipments, nevertheless placed them
under suspicion in certain quarters. Though the prototype
had trunnions like a gun, the carronades afterwards cast were
attached by lugs to wooden slides which recoiled on slotted
carriages pivoted to the ship’s side timbers, the slide being
secured to the carriage by a vertical bolt which passed down
through the slot. The recoil was limited by breechings; but as
these stretched continuously the bolt eventually brought up
with a blow against the end of the slot in the carriage: the bolt
broke, and the carronade was disabled. This happened at
Praya Bay, where the carronades broke their beds, owing to
slack breechings, after a few rounds. Captains complained, too,
that the fire of the carronades was a danger to the shrouds and
rigging.</p>

  <div class="caption">A CARRONADE</div></div>

<p>In spite of these views the popularity of the new ordnance
increased so rapidly that in January, 1781, there were, according
to the historian James, 429 ships in the royal navy which
mounted carronades. On the merits of these weapons opinion
was still very much divided. The board of ordnance was
against their adoption; the navy board gave them a mild
approval. In practice considerable discretion appears to have
been granted to the commanders of ships in deciding what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
armament they should actually carry.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> But the uncertainty
of official opinion gave rise to a surprising anomaly: <em>the
carronade, although officially countenanced, was not recognized
as part of the orthodox armament of a ship</em>. What was the cause
of this is not now clear. It has been said in explanation, that
the carronade formed too fluctuating a basis on which to rate a
ship’s force; that a long-gun basis afforded a key to the stores
and complement of a ship, whereas carronades had little effect
on either complement or stores; or that it may have been
merely inertia on the part of the navy board. Whatever the
cause, the ignoring of the carronade, in all official quotations of
ships’ armaments, led to great uncertainty and confusion in
estimating the relative force of our own and other navies, to
suggestions of deception on the part of antagonists, to the
bickering of historians and the bewilderment of the respective
peoples. This extraordinary circumstance, that carronades
with all their alleged advantages were not thought worthy to
be ranked among the long guns of a ship, is commented on at
length by James. “Whether,” he says, “they equalled in
calibre the heaviest of these guns, added to their number a full
third, or to their power a full half, still they remained as mere
a blank in the ship’s nominal, or rated force, as the muskets in
the arm-chest. On the other hand, the addition of a single<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
pair of guns of the old construction, to a ship’s armament,
removed her at once to a higher class and gave her, how novel or
inconvenient soever, a new denomination.”</p>

<p>While the products of the Carron firm were gaining unexpected
success in the defence of merchant shipping, their
value in ships of the line was not to remain long in doubt.
Some of the heavier carronades had been mounted in the
<i>Formidable</i>, <i>Duke</i>, and other ships, and their presence had a
material effect in Admiral Rodney’s action of April, 1782. As
had been generally recognized, the carronade was especially
suited to the British aims and methods of attack—the destruction
of the enemy by a yard-arm action. To the French, whose
strategy and methods were fundamentally different, its value
was less apparent. So that for long this country reaped alone
the benefit of its invention; until in somewhat half-hearted
way France gradually adopted it, and then mostly in the
smaller sizes, and more apparently with a view to defence than
for offensive purposes. In the action with de Grasse the
carronades of the British fleet operated, in the opening stages,
as an additional incentive to the enemy to avoid close quarters.
And later, at the in-fighting, their weight of metal contributed
in no small degree to the superiority of fire which finally forced
him to surrender.</p>

<p>It was later in this same year that the carronade won its
most dramatic victory as armament of a small ship. In order
to give a thorough trial to the system the navy board had
ordered the <i>Rainbow</i>, an old 44, to be experimentally armed
with large carronades, some of which were of as large a calibre
as the original Smasher; by which her broadside weight of
metal was almost quadrupled. Thus armed she put to sea and
one day fell in with the French frigate <i>Hébé</i>, armed with
18-pounder long guns. Luring her enemy to a close-quarter
combat, the <i>Rainbow</i> suddenly poured into the Frenchman the
whole weight of her broadside. The resistance was short, the
<i>Hébé</i> surrendered, and proved to be a prize of exceptional
value as a model for frigate design. The capture was quoted as
convincing proof of the value of a carronade armament, and
the type continued from this time to grow in popularity, until
the termination of the war in 1783 put a stop to further experiments
with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>Throughout the long war which broke out ten years later the
carronade played a considerable part in the succession of duels
and actions which had their climax off Trafalgar. It was now
generally adopted as a secondary form of armament, captains
being permitted, upon application, to vary at discretion the
proportion of long-gun to carronade armament which they
wished to carry. In the smaller classes especially, a preponderance
of carronades was frequently accepted; the accession
of force caused by the substitution of small carronades
for 6-and 9-pounder long guns in brigs and sloops could
hardly be disputed. In ships-of-the-line the larger sizes continued
in favour. The French now benefited, too, by their
adoption; on more than one occasion their poop and forecastle
carronades, loaded with langrage, played havoc with
our personnel. Spaniards and Dutchmen did not carry them.
How far their absence contributed to their defeats it is not now
to inquire; but how the tide of battle would have been affected
by them—if the Dutch fleet, for instance, had carried them at
Camperdown—may be a not unprofitable speculation.</p>

<p>Early in the war the carronade system was to score its
greatest defensive triumph, and this, by a happy coincidence,
in the hands of the old <i>Rainbow’s</i> commander.</p>

<p>The <i>Glatton</i>, one of a few East Indiamen which had been
bought by the admiralty, was fitted out in 1795 as a ship of
war, and left Sheerness in the summer of the following year
under the command of Captain Henry Trollope to join a
squadron in the North Sea. At her commander’s request she
was armed with carronades exclusively. She was without ahead
or astern fire, without a single long bow or stern chaser; she
carried 68-pounder carronades along her sides, whose muzzles
were so large that they almost filled the small port-holes of the
converted Indiaman and prevented more than a small traverse.
Off the Flanders coast she fell in one night with six French
frigates, a brig-corvette, and a cutter; and at ten o’clock a
close action began. The <i>Glatton</i> was engaged by her antagonists
on both sides, her yard-arms almost touching those of the enemy.
She proved to be a very dangerous foe. Her carronades,
skilfully pointed and served by supply parties who worked
port and starboard pieces alternately, poured out their heavy
missiles at point-blank range. So heavy was her fire that one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
by one the frigates had to haul off, severely damaged, and the
<i>Glatton</i> was left at last to spend the night repairing her rigging
unmolested, but in the expectation that the French commodore
would renew the attack in the morning. To her surprise no
action was offered. The blows of the 68-pounders had done
their work. Followed by the <i>Glatton</i> with a “brag countenance,”
the enemy retired with his squadron in the direction of
Flushing.</p>

<p>The action had more than one lesson to teach, however,
and no more ships, except small craft, were armed after this
upon the model of the <i>Glatton</i>.</p>

<p>We must at this point mention an experiment made in the
year 1796, at the instance of Sir Samuel Bentham, in the
mounting of carronades on a non-recoil system. Sir Samuel,
who in the service of Russia had armed long-boats and other
craft with ordnance thus mounted, produced arguments before
the navy board for attaching carronades rigidly to ships’
timbers; so as to allow of no other recoil than that resulting
from the elasticity of the carriage and the materials connecting
it to the ship. The ordnance board reported against the new
idea. Sir Samuel pointed out that the idea was not new.
Both the largest and the smallest pieces used on board ship
(viz. the mortar and the swivel) had always been mounted
on the principle of non-recoil. He showed how bad was the
principle of first allowing a gun and its slide or carriage to
generate momentum in recoil and then of attempting to
absorb that momentum in the small stretch of a breeching-rope.
He argued that a rifle held at the shoulder is not allowed
to recoil: if it is, the rifleman smarts for it. He instanced the
lashing of guns fast to the ship, especially in chase, for the
purpose of making them carry farther. No; the novelty
consisted in preparing suitable and appropriate fastenings for
intermediate sizes of guns between the mortar and the swivel.
The adoption of his proposal, he contended, would result in
smaller guns’ crews, quicker loading, and greater safety.</p>

<p>As a result of these arguments certain sloops designed by
him were armed on this principle; and in other cases, notably
in the case of the boats used at the siege of Acre, the carronades
and smaller types of long gun were successfully mounted and
worked without recoil by attaching their carriages to vertical
fir posts, built into the hull structures to serve as front pivots.
But, generally, the system was found to be impracticable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
The pivots successfully withstood the stresses of carronades
fired with normal charges of powder; no permanent injury
resulted to the elastic hull structures over which the blows were
spread. But the factor of safety allowed by this arrangement
was insufficient to cover the wild use of ordnance in emergencies.
The regulation of charges and the prevention of
double-shotting was difficult in action, and pieces were liable
to be over-charged in the excitement of battle in a way which
Sir Samuel Bentham had failed to realize. Pivots were
broken, ships’ structures strained, and the whole system found
ill-adapted for warship requirements.</p>

<p>It was not till the war of 1812 that the fatal weakness of the
carronade, as primary armament, was fully revealed. The
Americans had not developed the carronade policy to the
same extent as ourselves, for transatlantic opinion was never
at this period enamoured of the short-range gun. Their well-built
merchant ships, unhampered by tonnage rules or by the
convoy system which had taken so much of the stamina from
British shipping, were accustomed to trust to their speed and
good seamanship to keep an enemy at a distance. Their
frigates, built under less pedantic restrictions as to size and
weight, were generally swifter, stouter and more heavily
armed than ours. And, though they included carronades
among their armament, these were not generally in so large
a proportion as in our ships, and in part were represented by
a superior type—the colombiad, a hybrid weapon of proportions
intermediate between the carronade and the long gun.
Our ships often depended heavily upon the carronade element
of their armament. Experience was soon to confirm what
foresight might, surely, have deduced: namely, that when
pitted against an enemy who could choose his range and
shoot with tolerable accuracy the carronade would find itself
in certain circumstances reduced to absolute impotence.</p>

<p>This was to be the fate and predicament of our ships on
Lakes Erie and Ontario, in face of the Americans. “I found
it impossible to bring them to close action,” the English
commodore reported. “We remained in this mortifying
situation five hours, having only six guns in all the squadron
that would reach the enemy, not a carronade being fired.”
The same lesson was to be enforced shortly afterwards on the
Americans. One of their frigates, the <i>Essex</i>, armed almost
exclusively with carronades, was fought by an English ship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
the <i>Phœbe</i>, armed with long guns. The <i>Essex</i>, it should be
noted, possessed the quality essential for a carronade armament,
namely, superior speed. But the <i>Phœbe</i> fell in with her
in circumstances when, owing to damage, her superior speed
could not be utilized. The captain of the <i>Phœbe</i> was able to
choose the range at which the action should be fought. He
kept at a “respectful distance”: within range of his own long
guns and out of range of his opponent’s carronades. Both
sides fought well, but the result was a foregone conclusion.
The <i>Essex</i>, disabled and on fire, had to surrender. From that
time the carronade was discredited. For some years after the
peace it found a place in the armament of all classes of British
ships, but it was a fallen favourite. The French commission
which visited this country in 1835 reported that, although
still accounted part of the regular armament of older ships, the
carronade was being replaced to a great extent by light long
guns in newer construction. Opinion certainly hardened more
and more against the type, and, gradually falling into disuse,
it was at last altogether abandoned.</p>

<p>There was a feature of the carronade, however, which if it
had been exploited might have made the story of the carronade
much longer: might, in fact, have made the carronade the
starting-point of the great evolution which ordnance was to
undergo in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. We
refer to the large area of its bore, as rendering it specially
suitable for the projection of hollow spheres charged with
powder or combustibles: in short, for shells. Although, as
shown by the inscription on the model presented to him,
General Melville’s invention covered the use of shell and
carcass shot, yet there was no general appreciation in this
country, at the time of its invention, of the possibilities which
the new weapon presented for throwing charges of explosive
or combustible matter against the hulls of ships. Empty
hollow shot were tried in the original Smasher for comparison
against solid shot, in case the latter might prove too heavy;—and
these, as was pointed out by an eminent writer on
artillery,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> possessed in an accentuated degree all the disadvantages
of the carronade system, their adoption being
tantamount to a reversion to the long-exploded granite shot
of the medieval ordnance—but the use of <em>filled</em> shell in connection
with carronades does not appear to have been seriously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
considered. The disadvantages of filled shell as compared
with solid shot were fairly obvious; their inferiority in range,
in penetrative power, in accuracy of flight, their inability to
stand double-shotting or battering charges—all these were
capable of proof or demonstration. Their destructive effect,
both explosive and incendiary, as compared with that of uncharged
shot, was surprisingly under-estimated. Had it been
otherwise, the carronade principle would have led naturally
to the introduction of the shell gun. “The redeeming trait in
the project of General Melville,” wrote Dahlgren, “the
redeeming trait which, if properly appreciated and developed,
might have anticipated the Paixhans system by half a century,
was hardly thought of. The use of shells was, at best, little
more than a vague conception; its formidable powers unrealized,
unnoticed, were doomed to lie dormant for nearly
half a century after the carronade was invented, despite the
evidence of actual trial and service.”</p>

<p>In other respects the carronade did good service in the
development of naval gunnery. Its introduction raised (as
we have seen) the whole question of windage and its effects,
and was productive of general improvement in the reduction
and regulation of the windage in all types of gun. By it the
advantages of quick firing were clearly demonstrated. And
by its adoption in the ship-of-the-line it contributed largely
to bring about that approach to uniformity of calibre which
was so marked a feature of the armament schemes of the first
half of the nineteenth century.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TRUCK CARRIAGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">From</span> the small truck, <em>trochos</em>, or wheel on which it ran,
the four-wheeled carriage which served for centuries
as a mounting for the long guns of fighting ships has
come to be known as a truck carriage: the gun, with trunnions
cast upon it, as a truck gun.</p>

<p>Artillery being from the first an affair common, in almost all
respects, to land and to sea service, and being applied to ships
as the result of its prior development on land, it would be
expected that naval practice should in its evolution follow
in the wake of that on land. And so it has, in the main, until
the time of the Crimean War; since when, completely revolutionizing
and in turn revolutionized by the rapid development
of naval architecture and material, it has by far surpassed land
practice both in variety and power. But while the wooden
ship imposed its limitations no branch of affairs, perhaps,
appeared to be more conservative in its practice than naval
gunnery. No material seemed less subject to change, no
service less inclined to draw lessons from war experience.
And in recent years the truck carriage has often been taken as
typifying the great lack of progress in all naval material which
existed between the sixteenth and the nineteenth centuries.</p>

<p>Whether there was in fact so great a stagnation as is commonly
supposed, and to what causes such as existed may have
been due, we may discern from an examination of the truck
carriage itself and of its development from the earliest known
forms of naval gun mounting.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>The first large ordnance to be used on land, having as its
object the breaching of walls and gates and the reduction of
fortresses, was mounted solidly in the ground in a way which
would have been impracticable on board a ship at sea. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
time, as the energy of discharge increased, this method of
embedding the gun in soil grew dangerous: a certain recoil
was necessary to absorb and carry off the large stresses which
would otherwise have shattered the piece. In time, too, as the
power of explosives and the strength of guns increased, their size
diminished; cannon, as we have seen, became more portable.
No longer embedded in earth or fixed on ponderous trestles,
they were transported from place to place on wheeled carriages.
And on these carriages, massive enough to stand the shock of
discharge and well adapted to allow a certain measure of recoil,
the land ordnance were fired with a tolerable degree of safety.</p>

<p>Both of these methods were followed in principle when guns
came to be used at sea.</p>

<p>In the early Mediterranean galley the cannon was mounted
in a wooden trough placed fore and aft on the deck in the bow
of the vessel. The trough was secured to the deck. In rear of
the cannon’s breech and in contact with it was a massive bitt
of timber, worked vertically, which took the force of the recoil.
Later, as force of powder increased, this non-recoil system of
mounting ordnance failed. The cannon had to be given a
certain length of free recoil in order that, by the generation of
momentum, the energy which would otherwise be transmitted
to the ship in the form of a powerful blow might be safely
diverted and more gradually absorbed. Hence free recoil was
allowed within certain limits, the cannon being secured with
ropes or chains.</p>

<p>But, as had doubtless been found already with land
ordnance, the violence of recoil depended largely upon the
mass of the recoiling piece; for any given conditions of discharge
the heavier the gun, the less violent was its recoil. It
was a natural expedient, then, to make the recoiling mass as
large as possible. And this could be effected, without the
addition of useless and undesirable extra deadweight, by
making the wooden trough itself partake of the recoil. The
cannon was therefore lashed solidly to the trough, and both
gun and trough were left free to recoil in the desired direction.
The primitive mounting helped, in short, by augmenting the
weight of the recoiling mass, to give a quiet recoil and some
degree of control over the piece.</p>

<p>Later, this trough or baulk of timber performed an additional
function when used as a mounting for a certain form of gun.
When the piece was a breech-loader—like those recovered from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
the wreck of the <i>Mary Rose</i>—the trough had at its rear end a
massive flange projecting upwards, forming the rear working
face for the wedge which secured the removable breech
chamber to the gun. “The shot and wadde being first put into
the chase,” wrote Norton in 1628, “then is the chamber to be
firmly wedged into the tayle of the chase and carriage.” The
mounting was, in fact, an integral part of the gun. In the
8-inch breech-loading equipment of the <i>Mary Rose</i> which lies
in the museum of the Royal United Service Institution in
Whitehall there is evidence of two small rear wheels. Most of
these early ship carriages had two wheels, but for the more
powerful muzzle-loaders introduced toward the middle of the
sixteenth century, four came into favour. With four wheels
our timber baulk has become a primitive form of the truck
carriage of the succeeding centuries.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>But perhaps the truck carriage may more properly be
regarded as a derivative of the wheeled mounting on which, as
we have seen, land ordnance came eventually to be worked.
The ship being a floating fort, the mode of mounting the guns
would be that in vogue in forts and garrisons ashore, and the
land pieces and their massive carriages would be transferred,
without modification, for use on shipboard. How different the
conditions under which they worked! The great cannon,
whose weight and high-wheeled carriages were positive
advantages when firing from land emplacements, suitably
inclined, were found to work at great disadvantage under sea
conditions. Their great weight strained the decks that bore
them, and their wheeled carriages proved difficult to control
and even dangerous in any weather which caused a rolling or
pitching of the gun platform. With the introduction of portholes
their unfitness for ship work was doubtless emphasized;
there was neither height nor deck-space enough to accommodate
them between decks. Hence the necessity for a form of
carriage suitable for the special conditions of sea service, as
well as for a size of gun which would be within the capacity of
a ship’s crew to work. In the early Tudor ships the forms of
mounting were various: guns were mounted on two or four-wheeled
carriages, or sometimes, especially the large bombards,
upon “scaffolds” of timber.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> By Elizabeth’s reign the limit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
had been set to the size of the gun; the demi-cannon had been
found to be the heaviest piece which could be safely mounted,
traversed, and discharged. This and the smaller guns which
were plied with such effect against the Spanish Armada
were mounted on low, wheeled, wooden carriages which were
the crude models from which the truck carriage, the finished
article of the nineteenth century, was subsequently evolved.
Even then the carriages had parts which were similar and
similarly named to those of the later truck carriage; they had
trunnion-plates and sockets, capsquares, beds, quoins, axle-trees,
and trucks.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> On them the various pieces—the demi-cannons,
the culverins, the basilisks and sakers—were worked
by the nimble and iron-sinewed seamen; run out by tackles
through their ports, and traversed by handspikes. Loaded and
primed and laboriously fired by means of spluttering linstocks,
the guns recoiled upon discharge to a length and in a direction
which could not be accurately predicted. The smaller guns, at
any rate, had no breechings to restrain them: these ropes being
only used for the purpose of securing the guns at sea, and
chiefly in foul weather.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>On the whole these low sea carriages appear to have proved
satisfactory, and their continued use is evidence that they
were considered superior to those of the land service pattern.
“The fashion of those carriages we use at sea,” wrote Sir
Henry Manwayring in 1625, “are much better than those of
the land; yet the Venetians and others use the other in their
shipping.” In essentials the carriage remained the same from
Elizabeth to Victoria. Surviving many attempts at its supercession
in favour of mechanically complicated forms of mounting,
it kept its place in naval favour for a surprising length of
time; challenging with its primitive simplicity all the elaborate
mechanisms which pitted themselves against it.</p>

<p>An illuminating passage from Sir Jonas Moore’s treatise on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
artillery, written in 1689 and copied from the <cite>Hydrographie</cite> of
the Abbé Fournier, shows at a glance the manner in which the
armament of small Mediterranean craft of that period was
disposed, and the method on which the guns were mounted.
“At sea the ordnance are mounted upon small carriages, and
upon four and sometimes two low wheels without any iron
work. Each galley carries ordinarily nine pieces of ordnance in
its prow or chase, of which the greatest, and that which
delivers his shot just over the very stem, and lies just in the
middle, is called the Corsiere or ‘cannon of course’ or ‘chase
cannon,’ which in time of fight doth the most effectual service.
It carries generally a shot of thirty-three or forty pounds
weight, and are generally very long pieces. It recoils all along
the middle of the galley to the mast, where they place some
soft substance to hinder its farther recoil, that it might not
endamage the mast. Next to this Corsiere are placed two
Minions on each side, which carries a five or six-pound ball; and
next to these are the Petrieroes, which are loaded with stone-shot
to shoot near at hand. Thirdly, there are some small
pieces, which are open at the breech, and called Petrieroes a
Braga, and are charged with a moveable chamber loaded with
base and bar shot, to murder near at hand. And the furthest
from the Corsiere are the Harquebuss a Croc, which are charged
with small cross-bar shot, to cut sails and rigging. All these
small pieces are mounted on strong pins of iron having rings,
in which are placed the trunnions with a socket, so that they
are easily turned to any quarter.</p>

<p>“All the guns are mounted upon wheels and carriages; moreover
the Petrieroes, which are planted in the forecastle and
quarter to defend the prow and stern, are mounted upon strong
pins of iron without any reverse; the greatest pieces of battery
are planted the lowest, just above the surface of the water,
the smallest in the waist and steerage, and with the Petrieroes
in quarter-deck and forecastle. Upon the sea, to load great
ordnance they never load with a ladle, but make use of cartridges,
as well for expedition as security in not firing the
powder, which in time of fight is in a continual motion.”</p>

<p>Before passing to a consideration of the truck carriage in
detail there is an important circumstance to be noted with
regard to the conditions under which its design and supply to
the naval service were regulated. It is a remarkable fact that,
during almost the whole of what may be called the truck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
carriage era, the arming of ships with ordnance, the supply of
the requisite guns and their carriages, the design of the guns
and their mode of mounting, was no part of a naval officer’s
affair. The Board of Ordnance had control both of land and of
sea artillery. From the death of Sir William Wynter onwards
the mastership of the ordnance by sea was absorbed into the
mastership of the ordnance by land. From this arrangement,
as may be imagined, many inconveniences arose, and many
efforts were made at various times to disjoin the offices and to
place the armament of ships under naval control. For, apart
from the fact that at an early date the ordnance office acquired
“an unenviable reputation for sloth and incapacity,”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> the
interests of the sea service were almost bound to suffer under
such a system. And in fact the inconvenience suffered by the
navy, through the delays and friction resulting from the
system whereby all dealings with guns and their mountings
and ammunition were the work of military officials, was
notorious. The anomalous arrangement survived, in spite of
the efforts of reformers, till far into the nineteenth century.
Probably the Board of Ordnance argued honestly against
reintroducing a dual control for land and sea artillery material.
They had, at any rate, strong interests in favour of the status
quo. For, writing in the year 1660, Sir William Slingsby noted
regretfully that “the masters of the ordnance of England,
having been ever since of great quality and interest, would
never suffer such a collop to be cut out of their employment.”</p>

<p>The arming of ships, therefore, apart from the original
assignment of the armament, remained in the province of the
military authorities.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>An examination of the design of the perfected truck carriage
and a glance at the records of its performances in action show
that the advocates of rival gun mountings were not altogether
incorrect in their contention that the manner in which the
broadside armament of our ships was mounted was wrong
in principle and unsatisfactory in actual detail. The many
defects of the truck carriage were indeed only too obvious.</p>

<p>In the first place, the breechings were so reeved that the
force sustained by them in opposition to the recoil of the gun
tended inevitably to cause the piece to jump. The reaction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
the breeching acted along lines below the level of the gun-axis;
the breeching therefore exerted a lifting force which, instead
of pressing down all of the four trucks upon the deck and
thus deadening the recoil, tended to raise the fore trucks in
the air and reduce the friction of the carriage upon the deck.
The larger the gun and the higher the gun-axis above the
trucks, the greater was this tendency of the gun to lift and
overturn. If the rear trucks, about which the gun and carriage
tended to revolve, had been set at some distance in rear of
the centre of gravity of the equipment, it would have been
rendered thereby more stable. But space did not permit of
this. And actually they were so placed that, when discharge
was most violent, the weight of the equipment was scarcely
sufficient to oppose effectively the tendency to jump. Again,
the anchoring of the breeching to two points in the ship’s
frames, one on either side of the gun, was wrong and liable to
have serious consequences. For with this arrangement not
only had the breeching to be continuously “middled” as the
gun shifted its bearing, but even when accurately adjusted
the “legs” of the breeching bore an unequal strain when the
gun was fired off the beam. In other words, the horizontal
angles subtended between the gun-axis, when off the beam,
and the two lines of the breeching were unequal; one side
of the breeching took more of the blow of gunfire than the
other; and not infrequently the gun carriage was thrown
round violently out of the line of recoil, with damage to the
equipment and injury to the crew.</p>

<p>The design of the carriage was in no way influenced, apparently,
by a desire to obtain a minimum area of port opening
in combination with a maximum traverse of the gun. For the
broad span of the front part of the carriage soon caused the
gun to be “wooded” when slewed off the beam. And a
further disadvantage of this broad span was in the effect it
had of automatically bringing the gun right abeam every
time it was hauled out after loading: the front span of the
carriage coming square with the timbers of the port-sill.</p>

<p>As for the system of recoil, while the recoiling of the carriage
with the gun had an advantage in reducing the stresses brought
on the hull structure, yet this arrangement had the correlative
disadvantage that the carriage as well as the gun had to be
hauled out again. And, as regards safety, it is a matter for
surprise that the system of chocking recoil by means of large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
ropes—of absorbing the momentum of a heavy gun and its
carriage in a distance corresponding to the stretch of the
breechings under their suddenly applied load—was not far
more injurious than experience proved to be the case. Even
so, the results obtained from it were far from satisfactory.
“It is a lamentable truth”—we quote Sir William Congreve,
writing in 1811—“that numbers of men are constantly
maimed, one way or another, by the recoiling of the heavy
ordnance used on board ships of war. Most of the damage is
done by the random recoil of the carriage which, moving with
the gun along no certain path, is much affected by the motion
of the vessel and the inequalities of the deck. It is difficult
to know, within a few feet, to where the carriage will come,
and the greatest watchfulness is necessary on all hands to
prevent accidents.” This refers, observe, to the truck gun
under control. How terrible an uncontrolled gun could be,
may be read in the pages of Victor Hugo’s <cite>Quatre-Vingt-Treize</cite>,
of which romance the breaking loose of a piece on the gun-deck
of a frigate forms a central incident. It was conjectured
that the old <i>Victory</i>, Admiral Balchen’s flagship which went
down off the Casquets in 1744, “mouse and man,” was lost
through the breaking loose of her great guns in a gale.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

  <div class="caption">A TRUCK GUN</div></div>

<p>The accessories of the truck carriage were a source of
frequent accident. The attachment of breechings and tackles
to the ship’s side often involved disablement in action, the
numerous bolts being driven in as missiles among the crew,
who were also in danger of having their limbs caught up in
the maze of ropes and trappings with which the deck round
the gun was encumbered. Considered as a mechanism the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
whole gun-equipment was a rude and primitive affair; the
clumsy carriage run out to battery by laborious tackles, the
cast-iron gun laid by a simple wedge, the whole equipment
traversed by prising round with handspikes—by exactly
the same process, it has been remarked, as that by which the
savage moved a log in the beginning of the world.</p>

<p><em>Why, then, did the truck carriage maintain its long supremacy?</em></p>

<p>The answer is, that with all its acknowledged defects it
had merits which universally recommended it, while its
successive rivals exhibited defects or disadvantages sufficient
to prevent their adoption to its own exclusion. It was a case,
in fact, of the survival of the fittest. And if we examine its
various features in the light of the records of its performances
in action (the truck carriage appears in the background of
most of our naval letters and biographies), we shall understand
why it was not easily displaced from favour with generation
after generation of our officers and seamen.</p>

<p>In the first place the truck carriage, a simple structure of
resilient elm, with bed, cheek-plates, and trunnions strongly
fitted together and secured by iron bolts, was better adapted
than any other form for the prevention of excessive stresses,
resulting from the shock of recoil, on either gun or ship’s
structure. By the expedient of allowing the whole gun
equipment to recoil freely across the deck, by allowing the
energy of recoil to assume the form of kinetic energy given to
the gun and carriage, the violent reactionary stresses due to
the sudden combustion of the gunpowder were safely diverted
from the ship’s structure, which was thus relieved of nearly
the whole of the firing stresses. Moreover, by allowing the
gun to recoil readily under the influence of the powder-gases
the gun itself was saved from excessive stresses which would
otherwise have shattered it. From this point of view the
weight of the carriage, relatively to that of the gun, was of
considerable importance. If the carriage had been at all too
heavy it would not have yielded sufficiently under the blow
of the gun, and, howsoever strongly made, would eventually
have been destroyed, if it had not by its inertia caused the
gun to break; if too light, the violence of the recoil would have
torn loose the breechings. Actually, and as the result of a
process of trial-and-error continuously carried on, the weight
of the finally evolved elm carriage was so nicely adapted to
that of its gun that a recoil of the most suitable proportions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
was generally obtained, a free yet not too boisterous run back.
This, of course, upon an even keel. Conditions varied when
the guns were at sea upon a moving platform. With the ship
heeled under a strong wind the weather guns were often fired
with difficulty owing to the violence of the recoil. On the
other hand the listing of the ship when attacking an enemy
from windward favoured the lee guns by providing a natural
ramp up which they smoothly recoiled and down which they
ran by gravity to battery, as in a shore emplacement. Of
which advantage, as we know, British sea tactics made full use
at every opportunity.</p>

<p>It was strong, simple, and self-contained. Metal carriages,
whose claims were periodically under examination, proved
brittle, too rigid, heavy, and dangerous from their liability
to splinter. Gunslides, traverses, or structures laid on the
deck to form a definite path for the recoil of the gun (such as
the Swedish ships of Chapman’s time, for example, carried)
were disliked on account of their complication, the deck-space
occupied, and the difficulty which their use entailed of keeping
the deck under the gun dry and free from rotting; though
beds laid so as to raise the guns to the level of the ports were
sometimes fitted, and were indeed a necessity in the earlier
days owing to the large sheer and camber given to the decks.
The use of compressors, or of adjustable friction devices,
in any form, for limiting the recoil, was objected to on account
of the possibilities which they presented for accident owing to
the forgetfulness of an excited crew. The truck carriage, being
self-contained and independent of external adjustment, was
safe in this respect.</p>

<p>The four wood trucks were of the correct form and size to
give the results required. The resistance of a truck to rolling
depends largely upon the relative diameters of itself and its
axle. It was thus possible, by making gun-carriage trucks of
small diameter and their axles relatively large, to obtain the
following effect: on gunfire the carriage started from rest
suddenly, the trucks skidding on the deck without rotating
and thus checking by their friction the first violent motion of
recoil; during the latter phase of the recoil the trucks rotated,
and the carriage ran smoothly back until checked by the
breechings.</p>

<p>The friction of the trucks on the deck was also affected,
however, by another feature of the design: the position of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
the trunnions relatively to the axis of the gun. How important
was this position as influencing the history of land artillery,
we have already seen. Truck guns were nearly always
“quarter-hung,” or cast with their trunnions slightly below
their axis, so as to cause the breech to exert a downward
pressure on firing, and thus augment the friction of the rear
trucks on the deck and check the recoil. The position of the
trunnions was studied from yet another point of view: namely,
to give the minimum of jump to the gun and ensure a smooth
start to the recoil. With this object they were so placed that
the two ends of the gun were not equally balanced about the
trunnion axis, but a preponderance of about one-twentieth of
the weight of the gun was given to the breech-end, thus
bringing a slight pressure, due to deadweight alone, upon the
quoin.</p>

<p>As for this quoin or primitive wedge by which the gun was
roughly laid, this had a great advantage over the screw (which
gained a footing, as an alternative, when the carronade came
into use) in that it allowed of rapid changes of elevation of the
gun. Hence, though the quoin was liable to jump from its
bed on gunfire and do injury to the crew, it kept its place
as an accessory almost as long as the truck carriage itself
survived.</p>

<p>There was one advantage possessed by the truck carriage
which was perhaps the most important of all: its superior
transportability. The gun equipment was easily transferable,
and what this meant to the seaman may be gathered from the
accounts of the way in which, in sailing-ship days, ships’
armaments were continually being shifted. The armament,
we have noted, was not embodied, as it is to-day, as an integral
part of the design of the ship. The guns and their carriages
were in the nature of stock articles, which could be changed in
size, number and position according to the whim of the
captain or the service of the ship. And there was every reason
why all parties concerned, and especially the ordnance people,
should tend to standardize the forms of guns and carriages, to
keep them self-contained and as independent as possible of the
special requirements of individual ships or positions. The
shifting of guns was constantly going on in a commissioned
ship. At sea they were lashed against the sides so as to leave as
clear a deck as possible. In chase a shifting of guns, among
other heavy weights, was resorted to in order that the vessel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
should not lose way by plunging heavily. If she set sail on a
long voyage some of the guns were struck down into the hold,
to stiffen her and give her an increased stability. And on her
return to harbour the guns might be removed for examination
and repair by the ordnance officials, the ship being laid alongside
a sheer hulk for the purpose. In the days before the
sheathing of ships’ bottoms was successfully practised, and in
the absence of docks, it was constantly necessary to careen
ships for the repair of their ground-timbers, for the cleaning
of their sides and the caulking of their seams. This, again,
necessitated a shifting or complete removal of most of their
stores and ordnance. Great advantages were offered, therefore,
from having gun-carriages compact, self-contained, and
capable of being quickly removed from one place to another.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>Having inspected the truck carriage in some detail, let us
now briefly glance at the development of its use which took
place in the last hundred years of its service, between the
middle of the eighteenth and the middle of the nineteenth
centuries.</p>

<p>The stream of improvement in naval gunnery began to flow
strongly under the administration of Lord Anson. New
methods of firing, experiments with priming tubes to replace
the primitive powder horns and trains of vent powder, and gun
locks to replace the dangerous and unreliable slow match and
linstock,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> were under trial in the fleets commanded by Admiral
Hawke, but with results not altogether satisfactory. The locks
supplied were lacking in mechanical precision, and the tubes—“very
pernicious things” they were voted—were apt to fly
out and wound the men. But that the unsatisfactory results
obtained were not due to defects inherent in the new devices
was soon clearly proved. Twenty years later an eminent
gunnery officer, Sir Charles Douglas, by perseverance and an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
enthusiastic attention to mechanical detail, succeeded in making
both locks and priming tubes a practical success, greatly
enhancing by their aid the rate and effectiveness of fire of the
great guns. Flint-locks of his own design he bought and fitted
to the guns of his ship at his private expense. Flannel-bottomed
cartridges, to replace the parchment-covered cartridges
which had caused so much fouling, and goose-quill
priming tubes, were provided by him, and to him is certainly
due the credit for initiating the series of improvements in
material which, trivial as they may seem in detail, yet in the
aggregate had the effect of placing our gunnery at a relatively
high level in the ensuing wars.</p>

<p>In addition to introducing improvements in methods of
firing, Sir Charles Douglas did much to improve the efficiency
of the truck carriages themselves. On his appointment to the
<i>Duke</i> in 1779 he at once began to put his schemes in hand.
To ease the recoil of the guns and to save their breechings he
devised and fitted steel springs in some way to the latter;
with such surprising good effect (he reported) that even with a
restricted length of recoil no breeching, not even that of a
32-pounder weather gun double-shotted and fired over a
slippery deck, was ever known to break. The recoil he further
eased by loading the truck carriage with shot, which he slung
on it, thereby augmenting the recoiling mass. He also proposed
and tried another apparatus having the same effect:
suspended weights, secured to the carriage by ropes reeved
through fairleads, which on recoil the gun was made to lift.
Which weights also had an effect in helping to run the gun out
again which he calculated to be equal to that of two extra men
on the tackles.</p>

<p>Perhaps the principal improvements due to Sir Charles
Douglas were those which had as their object the firing of
ships’ guns on other bearings than right abeam. He realized
the importance of possessing a large arc of training for his guns;
and with this object he cleared away all possible obstructions
on the gun decks of the <i>Duke</i>, removing and modifying knees,
standards and pillars to allow his guns to be pointed a full
four points before and abaft the beam: a degree of obliquity
hitherto unknown in the navy for broadside armament. To
traverse the carriages quickly to the required line of bearing he
had eyebolts fitted in line between the guns for attachment to
the tackles; and to shorten and control the recoil and thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
allow of firing on an extreme bearing in a confined space, and
also to improve the rate of fire, he shod the carriage-trucks
with wedges designed to act as drags. “We now dare to fire
our guns without running them out,” he wrote to Lord Barham,
“and so as to admit of the ports being shut, with certain
impunity, even to the obliquity of three points before or abaft
the beam. A wedge properly adapted is placed behind each
truck, to make up for the reduction of space to recoil in, in
firing to windward or in rolling weather. The gun first ascends
the wedges by rotation, and when stopped, performs the
remainder of her recoil as a sledge, so feebly as scarce to bring
her breeching tight. The bottoms of the wedges, to augment
their friction against the deck, are pinked, tarred, and rubbed
with very rough sand or with coarse coal dust. This method
has also, I hear, been adopted in the <i>Union</i>.”</p>

<p>It was also adopted in the <i>Formidable</i>, in which ship Sir
Charles fought as first captain to Admiral Rodney in the great
fight which took place three years after the above was written.
At the Battle of the Saints not a single goose-quill failed in the
<i>Formidable</i>, nor did a gun require to be wormed so long as the
flannel-bottomed cartridges held out. Of the hundred and
twenty-six locks fitted in the <i>Duke</i>, only one failed; with this
exception a single Kentish black flint served for each gun
throughout the whole engagement. The oblique fire which our
ships were enabled to employ so shattered the enemy by the
unexpectedly rapid and concentrated fire poured into him,
that victory was not left long in doubt; the toll of his killed and
wounded was enormous. The <i>Duke</i>, it was reckoned, fired
twice as many effective shots as would have been possible
under the old system. The <i>Formidable</i> reported that two, and
sometimes three, broadsides were fired at every passing
Frenchman before he could bring a gun to bear in reply.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> If
all the ships of the fleet, it was said, had been able to use their
guns as they were used in these two, very few of the enemy
would have escaped. The advantage accruing to the British
fleets from the improvements initiated and developed by Sir
Charles Douglas and other captains of his time was palpable
and undisputed. It is possible, however, that the total effect
produced by all these developments in gunnery material, both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
in this action and in those of the following war, may have been
insufficiently emphasized by historians?</p>

<p>It is to the war which broke out with the United States of
America in 1812 that we must turn to see the truck equipment
working at its highest point of efficiency. By this time the advantage
of gun-sights<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> for giving accuracy of aim has been seized by
a few individual officers, and sights of various patterns have
been fitted by enthusiasts. No official encouragement is given,
however, to experiments with sights and scales and disparting
devices, and once again it is left to private initiative and
expense to make a further advance toward efficiency. Applications
for gun-sights are rejected during the war on the ground
that these novelties are “not according to the regulation of
the Service.”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p>These are the circumstances in which a certain vessel in the
royal navy exhibits such a superiority in gunnery over her contemporaries
as to render her conspicuous at the time and, for
several decades afterwards, the accepted model by which all
such as care may measure themselves.</p>

<p>The <i>Shannon</i>, nominally a 38-gun frigate, carried twenty-eight
18-pounder long guns on her gun deck and fourteen
carronades, 32-pounders, upon her quarter-deck and forecastle;
in addition to four long 9-pounders. She was commanded by
Captain Philip Broke, whose fame as a gallant commander is
secure for all time but whose attainments in the realm of
gunnery have been less widely appreciated. Captain Broke,
possessing a keen insight into the possibilities of the <i>Shannon’s</i>
armament, set himself to organize, from the first day of his
ship’s memorable commission, her crew and material for the
day of battle. No other ship of the time was so highly
organized. For all the guns sighting arrangements were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
provided by him. To each gun-carriage side-scales of his own
design were attached, marked with a scale of degrees and
showing by means of a plumb-bob the actual heel of the ship;
so that every gun could be laid by word of command at any
desired angle of elevation. For giving all guns a correct
bearing a circle was inscribed on the deck round every gun-port,
degrees being represented by grooves cut in the planks
and inlaid with white putty; by which device concentration
of fire of a whole battery was rendered possible, the sheer of
the ship being compensated for by cutting down the carriages
and adjusting them with spirit-levels.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>METHOD OF GUN-EXERCISE IN H.M.S. “SHANNON”</p>

<p class="smaller">From a pamphlet by Captain S. J. Pechell, R.N.</p></div></div>

<p>Beside these improvements applied to his material—steps
which seem simple and obvious to-day, but which were far-sighted
strides in 1812—the training of his personnel was a
matter to which he paid unremitting attention. His gunners
were carefully taught the mysteries of the dispart. Gun drill
was made as realistic as possible and prizes were given out of
his private purse for the winners of the various competitions.
Often a beef cask, with a piece of canvas four feet square
attached to it, was thrown overboard as a target, the ship
being laid to some three hundred yards away from it. The
captain’s log was full of such entries as: “Seamen at target,”
“fixed and corrected nine-pounder sights,” “mids at target
and carronade,” “swivels in maintop,” “practised with
musket,” “exercised at the great guns,” etc. etc. Systematic
instruction in working the guns, fixing sights and
reading scales, was carried out. And a method of practising
gun-laying, which later came to be used in other ships from the
example set by the <i>Shannon</i>, is illustrated by the accompanying
sketch. A gun was taken onto the quarter-deck and secured;
a spar was placed in its muzzle with a handspike lashed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
across it; and then two men surged the gun by means of the
handspike to imitate the rolling of the ship, while the captain
of the gun, crouching behind it, looked along his line of sight
for the target (a disc placed in the forepart of the ship) and
threw in the quoin when he had taken aim.</p>

<p>With such a training did the captain of the <i>Shannon</i> prepare
for the duel which fortune was to give him with the <i>Chesapeake</i>.
The pick of the British fleets was to meet an American of
average efficiency. Superiority of gunnery would have decided
that famous action in favour of the former, it may safely be
said, whatever the conditions in which it had been fought. At
long range the deliberate and practised aim of the <i>Shannon’s</i>
18-pounders would have overborne even the good individual
shooting of an American crew. At night or in foggy weather
or in a choppy sea the <i>Shannon’s</i> arrangements for firing on a
given bearing and at a given elevation would have given her
the superiority. As it happened, the combined and correct
fire at pistol range, of long gun and carronade—the long gun,
double-shotted, searching the <i>Chesapeake’s</i> decks with ball and
grape, the carronade splintering her light fir-lined sides and
spreading death and destruction among the crew—quickly
secured a victory, and showed the naval world the value of
high ideals in the technique of gunnery.</p>

<p>In the <i>Shannon</i> we have the high-water mark of smooth-bore
gunnery. From that time onward, in spite of the precedents
which her captain created, little appears to have been done in
the way of extending his methods or of applying his improvements
to the armament of the navy generally. As a consequence,
relatively to the continuously improving defensive
efficiency of the ships themselves there was an actual decline
in the efficiency of the truck gun after the American War: a
decline which culminated in Navarino. It was a time when
“new-fangled notions,” developments of method and material,
were viewed with strong suspicion, even with resentment, by
many of the most influential of naval officers. In the case of
the truck gun, strong prejudices reacted against the general
introduction of such refinements as had admittedly been found
effective in exceptional cases, and the demand still went up for
everything in connection with gunnery to be “coarsely
simple.” To many it doubtless seemed impolitic, to say the
least, that anything should be done in the way of mechanical
development which would have the effect of substituting pure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
skill for the physical force and endurance, in the exertion of which
the British seaman so obviously excelled. The truck gun was
merely the rough medium by which this physical superiority
gained the desired end, and it had been proved well suited to
the English genius. Nothing more was asked than a rough
equality of weapons. The arguments used against such finesse
in gunnery as that used by the commander of the <i>Shannon</i>
were much the same, it may be imagined, as those used at an
earlier date (and with better reason) to prohibit the use of the
mechanically worked crossbow in favour of the simple longbow,
strung by the athletic arm of the English archer.</p>

<p>That little was done for years to improve the truck gun
equipment, is evident from a letter, written in 1825 by Captain
S. J. Pechell and addressed to the Commander-in-Chief of the
Mediterranean squadron, deploring the defective equipment
of ships’ guns. Even at this date, it appears, few of the guns
were properly disparted, few had sights or scales fitted to
them. No arrangements had yet been generally adapted for
permitting horizontal, or what Captain Broke had called
“blindfold” firing; or for laying all the guns together by
word of command. The truck carriages still gave insufficient
depression, preventing a ship from firing her weather guns at
point-blank when listed more than four degrees. The quantity
of powder and shot allowed for exercise only amounted to one
shot for each captain of a gun in seven months. No instruction
was given in sighting or fixing sights, no system of instruction
in principles was followed. And once again, as in the seventeenth
century, the disadvantage under which naval gunnery
laboured by reason of the dual control in all matters pertaining
to the ordnance was strongly felt. “It is singular,” wrote
Captain Pechell, “that the arming of a ship is the only part of
her equipment which has not the superintendence of a Naval
Officer. We have no sea Officer at the Ordnance to arrange and
decide upon the proper equipment of Ships of War; or to
carry into effect any improvement which experience might
suggest. It is in this way that everything relating to the
Ordnance on board a Man of War has remained nearly in the
same state for the last thirty years; and is the only department
(I mean the naval part of it) that has not profited by
experience or encouraged Officers to communicate information.
Much might be done now that the Marine Artillery are stationed
at Portsmouth. At present it is not even generally known that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
a manual exercise exists.... If some such system were
adopted, we should no longer consider the length of an action
at its principal merit; the <i>Chesapeake</i> was beat in eleven
minutes!”</p>

<p>Captain Pechell was a firm believer in the desirability of
developing to its utmost British material. He had an enthusiastic
belief, moreover, in the possibilities of his personnel;
and stated his conviction that officers were only too anxious to
be given the chance of instruction, prophesying an emulation
among them and as great a desire to be distinguished “in
gunnery as in Seamanship.” His advocacy of a system of
gunnery training bore fruit later in the establishment of the
<i>Excellent</i> at Portsmouth. The scheme for the development of a
corps of scientific naval officers, which had been foreshadowed
by Sir Howard Douglas in his classic treatise on Naval Gunnery
and which was formulated later in detail by Captain Pechell,
was one of the reforms brought to maturity by Sir James
Graham in the year 1832.</p>

<p>Through all the subsequent changes of armament up to the
Crimean War, from solid shot to shell-fire, the truck carriage
maintained its place of favour. In 1811 Colonel (afterwards
Sir William) Congreve had published a treatise demonstrating
the defects of the truck carriage and proposing in its place a
far more scientific and ingenious form of mounting. It lacked,
however, some of the characteristics which, as we have seen,
gave value to the old truck carriage. Except where special
conditions gave additional value to its rival, the truck carriage
kept its place. In 1820 an iron carriage was tried officially,
for 24-pounders, but gave unsatisfactory results. In 1829 the
Marshall carriage was tried, offering important advantages
over the standard pattern. Its main feature was a narrow
fore-carriage separate from the recoiling rear portion, this fore-carriage
being pivoted to a socket in the centre of the gun-port.
But still the truck carriage survived the very favourable
reports given on its latest rival.</p>

<p>As concentration of fire became developed new fittings such
as directing bars, breast chocks and training racers made
their appearance and were embodied in its design. As the
power of guns and the energy requiring to be absorbed on recoil
increased, the rear trucks disappeared and gave place, in the
two-truck Marsilly carriage, to flat chocks which by the
friction of their broad surfaces against the deck helped more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
than trucks to deaden the motion of the carriage. The quoin,
perfected by the addition of a graduated scale marked to show
the elevation corresponding to each of its positions, gave place
at length to various mechanical forms of elevating gear. The
elm body was replaced by iron plates bolted and riveted
together. And then at length, with the continuous growth of
gun-energy, the forces of recoil became so great that the
ordinary carriage constrained by rope breechings could no
longer cope with them. The friction of wood rear-chocks
against the deck was replaced by the friction of vertical iron
plates, attached to the carriage, against similar plates attached
to a slide interposed between carriage and deck, and automatically
compressed: the invention, it is said, of Admiral
Sir Thomas Hardy. The truck carriage, as it had been known
for centuries, had at last been left behind in the evolution of
naval artillery.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>With the advent of modern gun mountings the old anomaly
of the divided responsibility of War Office and Admiralty
became unbearable; the necessity for a close adaptation of
each gun to its ship-position, for careful co-ordination of the
work of artillerist, engineer and shipbuilder, produced a crisis
which had important effects on future naval administration.
A single paragraph will suffice to show the position as it
presented itself in the early ’sixties. “There were a thousand
points of possible collision,” wrote the biographer of Captain
Cooper Key, the captain of the <i>Excellent</i>, “as it became more
and more certain that gun carriages, instead of being loose
movable structures capable of being used in any port, were
henceforth to be fixed in the particular port which was adapted
for them, with special pivoting bolts and deck racers—all part
of the ship’s structure. Where the War Office work began and
the Controller’s ended in these cases, no one knew, but the
captain of the <i>Excellent</i> came in as one interfering between a
married pair, and was misunderstood and condemned on both
sides.”</p>

<p>In 1866 the solution was found. Captain Cooper Key was
appointed to the Admiralty as Director-General of Naval
Ordnance.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SHELL GUN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> chief function of land artillery in its earlier days
was the destruction of material. The huge engines of
the ancients were of value in effecting from a safe
distance what the tortoise and the battering-ram could only
do at close quarters: the breaching of walls and the battering-in
of gates, doors and bulwarks. After the invention of gunpowder
the use of artillery remained, we have seen, substantially
the same. Apart from the moral effect on horse and man
of the “monstrous roare of noise” when in defence, the
offensive object of ordnance was almost entirely the breaching
of the enemy’s works. The guns were literally “pieces of
battery,” doing their slow work by the momentum of their
large projectiles.</p>

<p>Thus considered, artillery was not a very effective instrument.
And, just as in earlier times it had been sought to
supplement mere impact by other effects—by the throwing
into besieged fortresses of quicklime, for instance, “dead
horses and other carrion,”—so, after the arrival of gunpowder,
endeavour was made to substitute incendiarism or explosion
for the relatively ineffective method of impact. The use of
grenades, hand-thrown, was discovered. And then followed,
as a matter of course, their adaptation to the mortars already
in use for the projection of stones and other solid material.
These mortars, as in the case of the early cannon, were at first
made of an inconveniently large size; and, also as in the case
of cannon, they came later to be cast of more moderate proportions
to facilitate their transport and thus render them
more serviceable for operations in the field. Artillery was now
devoting its attention to the personnel. The result of this
evolution was the howitzer, a weapon whose value to land
armies was greatly enhanced by the discovery, by Marshal
Vauban at the end of the seventeenth century, of the efficacy
of the <em>ricochet</em>. Under this system the fuzed bomb or grenade,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
instead of being projected from a mortar set at a high elevation,
to describe a lofty and almost parabolic trajectory, was discharged
from a howitzer at a sufficiently low elevation to cause
it to strike the ground some distance short of its objective,
whence it proceeded, leaping and finally rolling along the
ground till it came to its target, where it exploded.</p>

<div id="ip_161" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 19.1875em;">
  <img src="images/i_p161.jpg" width="307" height="210" alt="" /></div>

<p>So far shell fire had developed on land. In sea warfare the
solid cannon ball remained the orthodox missile; the use of
explosive or incendiary shells was deemed so dangerous a
practice as to forbid its acceptance by the great maritime
powers, save in exceptional cases, until the nineteenth century.
Toward the end of the eighteenth century serious consideration
was given, by France especially, to the possibilities of shell
fire. Frenchmen felt restless and dissatisfied with the conditions
in which they were waging war with England. Sea
ordnance, which in the past had wrought so much by the
destruction of personnel, was becoming increasingly impotent,
not only against personnel but against ships themselves.
Trafalgar came as a proof of this, when not a single ship was
sunk by gunfire. Sea fighting was again resolving itself into a
straightforward physical struggle between the guns’ crews of
the opposing fleets, in which struggle the victory went by
attrition to the side which plied its guns with the greatest
rapidity and perseverance. Élan, enthusiasm, science, the
mental alertness of the individual, were bound to be overborne
in such a case by superior endurance, physique, coolness, and
sound workmanship. Both sides had a profound belief in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
superiority of their personnel in hand-to-hand conflict. Where
fighting was, as in the earliest days of the rival navies, “man
to man, lance to lance, arrow to arrow, stone to stone,” success
depended entirely upon courage and physical strength; and
in such cases, says Nicolas, the English were almost always
victorious. If, stated a French writer, sea actions could be
decided by hand-to-hand combat the arms of France would
triumph. But sea fights were in fact almost solely a matter of
artillery. If only the conditions of battle could be altered; if
only the forces of incendiarism or explosion could be summoned
to put the enemy ships-of-the-line in jeopardy, a short cut to
victory might be found or, at any rate, the superiority of
England in material might be seriously depreciated.</p>

<div id="ip_162" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 13.375em;">
  <img src="images/i_p162.jpg" width="214" height="231" alt="" /></div>

<p>Some time was to elapse, however, before France was to see
even the partial consummation of this fervent desire.</p>

<p>While the use of grenades, bombs, carcasses and other
explosive and incendiary missiles had been recognized on land
for centuries, an event occurred in the year 1788 which, coming
to the ears of Europe, should have had considerable effect in
turning the thoughts of artillerists to the possibilities of their
use at sea. In that year, some sixty-five years before the
action off Sinope, a Deptford shipwright who had risen to high
service under the Russian government fitted out for his
employers a flotilla of long-boats for an attack upon a Turkish
squadron. These long-boats Sir Samuel Bentham—he was
the ex-shipwright—armed with brass ordnance mounted on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
favourite non-recoil system, and for them he requisitioned a
large supply of shells, carcasses and solid shot. At the mouth
of the Liman river in the Sea of Azov the Russians, with these
insignificant war vessels, attacked a very superior force of
Turkish ships, and gained a complete victory. The effect of the
shells, fired at close range into the Turkish ships, was startling
and impressive. Great holes were torn in the sides of the
vessels, and fires were started which, in a favouring medium of
dry timber and paint and pitch, rapidly spread and caused the
squadron’s destruction.</p>

<p>No evidence can be quoted, it must be admitted, to show
that contemporary opinion realized how portentous was this
sea action; no stress is laid on the event in histories relating
to that time. Nor does another event which occurred at this
period appear to have caused the notice it deserved: the
firing, at the suggestion of a Captain Mercier, 35th Regiment,
of mortar shells from the British long 24-pounders, from
Gibraltar into the Spanish lines.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> Nor was Lieutenant
Shrapnel’s contemporaneous invention,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> of a shell containing
case shot explodable by a small bursting charge, developed or
the possible adaptation of its use for sea warfare fully appreciated.
Or, if authority did discern the eventual effect of these
innovations, a wholesome dread of their extension and development
in naval warfare appears to have dictated a policy of
calculated conservatism in respect of them, a suppression of
all ideas and experiments which had in view any intensifying
or improvement of our artillery methods. “So long as foreign
powers did not innovate by improving their guns, by extending
the use of carronades and, above all, by projecting shells
horizontally from shipping; so long it was our interest not to
set the example of any improvement in naval ordnance—the
value of our immense material might otherwise be depreciated.
Many of the defects which were known to exist, so long as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
they were common to all navies, operated to the advantage of
Great Britain.”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

<p>Apart from this consideration, however, it is remarkable how
small a value was set by English opinion, even at a late date,
upon explosive as compared with solid projectiles. The
obvious disadvantages of hollow spherical shell—their smaller
range, more devious flight and less penetrative power—were
emphasized; their admittedly greater destructive effect (even
taking into account the small bursting charges deemed suitable
for use with them) was rated at a surprisingly low figure.</p>

<p>The French, on the other hand, showed great eagerness to
explore the possibilities of shell fire in fighting ships. Addicted
to science, they searched unceasingly throughout the revolutionary
wars for some development of naval material which
would neutralize the obvious and ever-increasing superiority
of the British navy under existing conditions, even if it might
not actually incline the balance of power in their favour. To
this end they courted the use of incendiary projectiles. Our
own authorities, partly from a lively apprehension of the
danger believed to be inherent in their carriage and use in
wooden ships and partly from a feeling of moral revulsion
against the employment of what they genuinely believed to be
an unfair and unchivalrous agency, limited the use of fuzed
shells, carcasses and other fireworks as much as possible to
small bomb vessels of special construction—and inferior morals.
But in ships-of-the-line the use of such missiles was strongly
deprecated by naval opinion, and even the use of hand-grenades
in the tops was forbidden by some captains. Time justified
this cautious attitude. The French suffered for the precipitancy
with which they adopted inflammatory agents; fires
and explosions were frequent in their fleets; the history of
their navy in these wars—“la longue et funeste guerre de la
Révolution”—is lit up from time to time with the conflagrations
of their finest ships, prey to the improperly controlled
chemical forces of their own adoption. One example alone need
be cited: the <i>Orient</i> at the battle of the Nile. Even if the
French flagship was not set on fire by their direct agency,
small doubt exists that the spread of the fire which broke out
in her was accelerated by the presence of the combustibles
which, in common with most of the French ships, she carried.
Throughout the wars fuzed shells, carcasses, stinkpots, port-fires,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
proved far more terrible to friend than foe. And the foe
doubtless felt confirmed and fortified in his opinions that such
substances were quite unsuitable for carriage in warships. As
to the ethics of explosives even the French themselves seem to
have been doubtful. For, shortly after the battle in Aboukir
Bay, some of their officers accused an English captain of
having been so “unfair” as to use shells: an audacious
manœuvre on their part, for, on some of the shells in question
being produced and the gunner questioned as to whence they
came, “to the confusion of the accusers, he related that they
were found on board the <i>Spartiate</i>, one of the ships captured on
the first of August!”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>Continuous trials were carried out in France with shells fired
from guns. In 1798, following a series of successful experiments,
trials were prosecuted at Meudon by a special commission,
who caused 24-and 36-pound shells to be fired at a
target representing a ship-of-the-line, at ranges of 400 and
600 yards. The results were impressive, and the report
rendered to Bonaparte such as to confirm his personal conviction
in the value of shell fire. Less than a year later, we
may note in passing, the Consul was himself the target of shell
fire: being subjected, at the siege of Acre, to the unpleasant
attentions of a 68-pounder carronade from the English fleet.
In 1804, with the avowed object of keeping our cruisers at a
distance, he had long howitzers cast and placed for the defence
of Toulon and other ports. And hardly a year passed but some
trial was made of horizontal fire of shells from guns and
mortars.</p>

<p>Of the two great maritime powers, Britain had contributed
more, perhaps, towards the building up by actual practice of
the system of artillery which was shortly to come into vogue.
Shell fire from mortars had been used with far more effect by
her forces than by those of her great enemy. The invention of
the carronade was in itself almost a solution; and, though it
did not lead directly to the shell gun, yet it undoubtedly
induced the weapon which most strongly resembled it: the
medium ship-gun, as designed by Congreve and Blomefield,
which was something between the carronade and the long gun,
and which for a time was mounted in our two-decked ships for
the purpose of preserving unity of calibre.</p>

<p>But the French, free from the bias against change of method<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
and material which operated in this country, seized on the
possibilities of existing elements, and combined them in such
a way as to form a complete solution of the shell-fire problem.
To General Paixhans, the eminent officer of artillery, the credit
for this solution is undoubtedly due.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>The experiments of M. Paixhans, carried out in order to
confirm the theories on which his new system was founded,
extended over several years and resulted in the publication of
two books—the <cite>Nouvelle Force Maritime et Artillerie</cite>, 1822, and
<cite>Expériences faites sur une Arme Nouvelle</cite>, 1825.</p>

<p>In these works<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> the author developed in detail the scheme of
ship armament which was to win adoption, in the course of
time, in the French navy; whereby our own authorities were
also gradually forced to abandon methods and standards of
force by which the British navy had grown great. Two
principles formed the basis of this scheme:—(1) unity of calibre,
embodying the maximum simplification of means; (2) shell
fire, embodying the maximum augmentation of effect.</p>

<p>On these two principles M. Paixhans reared and elaborated
in minutest detail the revolutionary system with which his
name is associated. No new element or discovery was necessary
for giving effect to his designs. Indeed he expressly
disclaimed having introduced any novelty: “Nous n’avons
donc rien inventé, rien innové, et presque rien changé; nous
avons seulement réuni des élémens épars, auxquels il suffisait
de donner, avec un peu d’attention, la grandeur et les proportions
convenables, pour atteindre le but important que nous
étions proposé.” It may be said, in fact, that unity of calibre
had been an ideal sought for years before M. Paixhans’ time;
while shell fire, the New Arm of 1822, was almost the logical
consequence of Robins’ discoveries in the principles of gunnery,
extended as they were by the researches of Doctors Hutton and
Gregory. In particular, mention is made by M. Paixhans
himself of two of the results brought out by Dr. Hutton’s
experiments: one, that the length of the bore of a gun has but
a small effect upon the range of its projectile, the range varying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
as the fifth root of the length; two, that the muzzle velocity
may be considered to be independent of the weight of the gun.</p>

<p>As to the lack of novelty of shell fire on ship-board, M.
Paixhans gives a significant extract from French naval annals.
In 1690, it appears, a M. Deschiens had invented a means of
firing bombs from long guns horizontally, instead of parabolically
as from mortars. This secret was of great use to him;
for, falling in with four English ships at sea, he so surprised
them by this new invention that, fearful of being set on fire,
they drew off and did not attempt to renew battle. This same
French captain at a later date attacked two Dutch ships more
than a match for him, and, by means of these horizontally fired
bombs, sank one and disabled the other. But M. Deschiens
died and his secret with him; though, as M. Paixhans remarks,
this “secret” would have been easy to find if anyone had
looked for it.</p>

<p>A whole chapter of <cite>The Genuine Use and Effects of the Gunne</cite>,
written by Robert Anderson and published at London in 1674,
concerns “the shooting of Granados out of Long Gunnes.”</p>

<p>Briefly, the grand idea of M. Paixhans consisted in the
establishment of a fleet of steam vessels armed with guns
designed to project charged shells horizontally at considerable
velocities. But as this consummation could only be attained
by degrees, he proposed that in the meantime the existing
French fleet should be re-armed in such a way as to give to
each ship a maximum of force combined with unity of calibre.
This part of his scheme was applicable to solid shot (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">boulets
massifs</i>) as well as to shell (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">boulets creux</i>). But the former he
considered too ineffectual for use in future sea engagements.
Although they might be the most suitable projectiles for the
destruction of land works, the breaching of ramparts and the
battering of stone walls, yet hollow shot, filled with powder and
other combustible material, were far better adapted to rend
and set fire to defences of wood, impregnated with tar,
and, in time of action, replete with every species of inflammable
substance, and crowded with combatants. No,
M. Paixhans hoped to make solid shots entirely obsolete, by
adopting, in combination with small steam vessels, or, for the
present, in combination with the existing fleets of sailing ships,
an ordnance specially dedicated to shell fire, and to shell fire
alone. By its means the enormous superiority of Great
Britain would be effectually eliminated, or transferred into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
hands of France; her material would be rendered suddenly
obsolete, her maritime power would shrivel; and the power of
France would be augmented to such a degree that the defeat of
these islands might at last be encompassed.</p>

<p>Such was the amiable intention of M. Paixhans.</p>

<p>The arguments which he employed in favour of his revolutionary
proposals are of sufficient interest and importance,
perhaps, to merit consideration. The past histories of the two
navies showed, he argued, that the introduction of improvement
or of innovation into either navy was shortly afterwards
followed by its introduction into the other; so that there was
never any important change in the relative naval strength of
the two nations. It followed, therefore, that the only means by
which power could be wrested from the possessor of it, must be
such a change of system as would render useless the existing
means by which that power was sustained. How could this be
accomplished? Foreign nations had always felt the innate
strength of England, residing in the race of splendid seamen
(a highly specialized profession) who formed so great a part of
her population. France especially had felt her own weakness
in not possessing a reserve, a nursery of seamen, such as
England had. If only seamanship could be discounted——!
M. Paixhans proceeded to show that the coming of the steamer
was itself an event which would go a long way to discount a
superiority in seamanship. The accursed English “devil
boat,”<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> which had begun to spread its pall of smoke over all the
northern waters, might be, in truth, a potent friend to France.
Steam vessels required only a small and unskilled personnel to
man them, instead of prime seamen. Steam vessels could
always outstrip sailing ships, and thus could choose their own
range and accept or decline battle as occasion required. Moreover,
the effect of shell fire would be to upset completely the
balance of power existing between big ships and little ships, as
such. Instead of size being a measure of power, it would be a
measure of vulnerability. The larger the ship the more she
would be endangered. Costly three-deckers would cease to
exist, and in their place small steam vessels, fast and heavily
armed, easily manœuvred and perhaps encased in armour,
would hold power. Thus the great obstacle to the acquirement
by France of a large naval force—the necessity for a
numerous and experienced personnel—would be easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
removed. In short, the adoption of his scheme would in any
case be most favourable to France. Even if it were simultaneously
adopted by Great Britain its adoption would at least
ensure that in future the naval power of the two states would
be in proportion to the strength of their <em>whole</em> population,
instead of only that part of it familiarized with maritime affairs.</p>

<p>Considering first the conversion of the existing French navy,
he examined and enlarged upon the various inefficiencies
inherent in the usual disposition of ship armaments; in the
manner in which the unit and the number of units of artillery
force were selected for any individual design of ship; in the
variety of the units, and in the lack of system observed in the
various proportions between the gun, the charge and the
projectile. He observed that the constant tendency of
development, both in the French and in the English navy, was
in the replacing of smaller by greater calibres, by which process
the diversity of calibres was diminished and the effective force
of the armament increased. Continuing this process, it
appeared that the ideal armament would be reached, the
maximum degree of force would be attained, when unity of
calibre was achieved. When the calibre of the largest-sized
cannon carried on the principal gun deck of ships-of-the-line
was adopted as the sole calibre used, the maximum of force
would be attained: the greatest possible destructive effect
combined with the greatest possible simplification of means.
These remarks applied equally to a solid shot and to a shell gun
armament. If for some reason it were decided not to adopt
shell fire, nevertheless it would be of advantage to re-arm the
French sailing fleets on this principle, with guns of one calibre.</p>

<p>M. Paixhans proposed as the unit the French 36-pounder.
He explained the advantages to be derived from arming
existing ships-of-the-line with 36-pounders all of the same
calibre but of different weights on the respective decks. The
guns on different decks would take different charges and would
therefore project the shot with different muzzle velocities.
They would be disposed, the heaviest on the lower deck; a
lighter type (reamed out from 24-pounders) on the main deck;
still lighter guns on the upper deck, and 36-pounder carronades
on the quarter-deck and forecastle would complete the armament.</p>

<p>The employment of solid shot was not favoured by him, however,
and he claimed the results of various trials as showing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
superior offensive value of shells, when compared with solid
shot. Comparing a solid shot and a shell of the same external
dimensions discharged with the same muzzle velocity, the
former, he said, had only the advantage in superior range and
penetrative power. The latter, while having a range greater
than those at which sea actions were invariably fought and
sufficient penetrative power to effect a lodgment in a ship’s
timbers, required less powder to propel it, a lighter and therefore
more rapidly worked gun from which to discharge it, and
it had a destructive effect enormously greater than that of the
solid ball.</p>

<p>The complete proposal therefore involved the adoption of
shell guns exclusively, new guns being made and old guns
being reamed out as necessary to enable each ship to carry
pieces of one calibre alone. The calibre proposed as unit was
the long French 48-pounder. And, as an example of the way
in which M. Paixhans would convert armaments, the case of the
French 74-gun ship is here taken. This, with an existing
armament <span class="locked">of:—</span></p>

<p class="in0 in4">
28 36-pounders,<br />
30 18-pounders,<br />
14 6-pounders,<br />
14 6-pounder carronades,
</p>

<p class="in0">a total of 86 pieces throwing 2250 pounds of solid shot, he
would convert into a ship armed <span class="locked">with:—</span></p>

<p class="in0 in4">
28 48-pounders (reamed from 36-pounders),<br />
30 48-pounders (of same weight as 18-pounders),<br />
28 48-pounder carronades;
</p>

<p class="in0">eighty-six pieces throwing 3010 pounds of charged shell
weighing 35 pounds each.</p>

<p>For the new shell gun he proposed a design of iron howitzer
in which the distribution of metal was so adjusted as to give a
sufficient factor of safety at every section, while at the same
time allowing the total weight of the piece to be reduced to a
minimum. This <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">canon-à-bombe</i> was to be mounted on a stable
form of carriage, made without trucks but fitted with running-out
rollers and directing bars to control the line of fire and the
direction of recoil.</p>

<p>To those who were inclined to regard with feelings of horror
this new use of explosive missiles, this progress in the art of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
destruction, the inventor put the question, whether experience
had not proved that the perfection of arms had not had the
effect of making warfare actually less bloody; whether it was
not a fact worth consideration, that, while in days of old the
destruction and loss of life in battles was enormous, the loss of
English seamen by gunfire in the numerous combats of three
long and bitter wars of recent times amounted to less than five
thousand killed. And would not, therefore, further development
of arms be a positive benefit to humanity?<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<p>One other feature was put forward to complete this scheme
of re-armament, the importance of which it is unnecessary to
emphasize. M. Paixhans explored the possibility, by the
sacrifice of a tier or more of guns, of rendering all classes of
ships invulnerable by casing their sides with iron plates.
Although rejected at the time, and as the result of trials which
he himself carried out, this suggestion was destined to be
carried into effect in startling fashion some thirty years
later: with what consequences to naval architecture we shall
presently see. In connection with the scheme of re-armament
outlined by M. Paixhans in 1822 the suggestion was important
in that there was implied in it an admission of one of the two
weak features of the inventor’s system. The shell gun would
lose its superiority over the shot gun, and might indeed be
reduced to absolute impotence if, in imitation of France, the
enemy also cased his ships of war with iron. The solid shot
gun would once again have the advantage; in fact, that very
equilibrium of relative values which M. Paixhans was endeavouring
to destroy would once more obtain between the
navies of the two rival powers.</p>

<p>For this reason, presumably, and because the shell gun
system contained, though in a less degree, the disability
inherent in the carronade system—inferior ranging power,
enabling a clever opponent armed with long solid shot guns to
fight at a range which was too great for shell—the Paixhans
scheme was not adopted in its entirety by the French government
of the time. But the principle of unity of calibre was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
acclaimed and approved almost immediately, applied to solid
shot guns. The French 30-pounder was chosen as the unit.
In 1829 guns of this calibre, made on several different models
to suit the various decks and classes of ship, were mounted in
their fleets.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>In the meantime M. Paixhans had made further progress
toward perfecting the details of his shell gun system. A
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">canon-obusier</i> of 80 pounds was made to his design, a
chambered howitzer of the same weight (about 72 hundredweight)
as the French 36-pounder truck gun and of 22 centimetres
calibre. This was designed to project a hollow shell of
the same size as the French 80-pound solid shot, but weighing,
when its cavity was filled with a charge of 4 pounds of powder,
56 pounds French (62½ pounds English). The shell gun itself
was of a distinctive shape. The characteristics of short chase,
large bore, a chamber, a small propelling charge, and a scientific
elimination of all useless metal, resulted in a form of ordnance
quite different from that of the long-accepted smooth-bore
cannon. It was easily recognizable by its straight muzzle,
smooth lines and the absence of the usual ornaments and
reinforcing rings. When, eventually, the New Arm was
adopted by other powers, their shell guns too, though independently
evolved, were found to exhibit the same external
features: the features of what came to be known universally
as a “Paixhans gun.”</p>

<p>The terrific effect of charged shell, fired from this form of
gun with sufficient velocity to find a lodgment in a ship’s
timbers, was demonstrated at Brest in 1821 and 1824; in the
latter trials the target being a frigate, the <i>Pacificateur</i>, moored
in the roadstead. High range and accurate shooting were
obtained. The incendiary effect of the shell was prodigious:
so impressive, indeed, that in spite of a strong opinion in the
French navy against further carriage of bombs in ships-of-the-line,
the Commission recommended “that <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">canons-à-bombe</i>
be adopted, even in ships-of-the-line, but in small numbers.”</p>

<p>But though the principle of the shell gun was accepted by
experts, public opinion was not yet ready for the change. The
Commission had shown a sage circumspection in regard to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
extent of the change proposed; but public opinion was not
yet satisfied that the new arm was sufficiently safe. The
scheme suffered a long postponement. In the meantime
several further trials were held. The design of the piece was
again modified; a larger chamber was arranged and a support
was cast, at the commencement of the chase, for carrying a
sight. Tests <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à outrance</i> were made to find what maximum
charge such a shell gun would safely stand; and at last, in
1837, the principle of shell fire was accepted by the government,
the Paixhans gun being assigned a place in the prescribed
armament of the fleets of France. To the impairment
of the unity-of-calibre principle, lately achieved, shell guns of
22 centimetres were admitted as part-armament of ships the
greater number of whose pieces were 30-pounders firing
solid shot.</p>

  <div class="caption">A PAIXHANS GUN</div></div>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>In England the arguments in favour of a new and more
scientific adjustment of ship armament had not until this
date been clearly formulated. Of the tendency to a single
calibre there certainly had been many demonstrations in the
last decades of the eighteenth century: a tendency favoured
by the replacement of the smaller long guns of the fleet by
carronades. Sir Howard Douglas, in his <cite>Naval Gunnery</cite>, the
first edition of which was published in 1820, had demonstrated
the advantages of large calibre, the inefficiency of
random broadsides, and the high importance of the deliberate
aim of single guns. And in 1825, before the French began to
remodel their ordnance, Colonel Munro, of the Royal Artillery,
submitted his project to the naval authorities of arming our
ships solely with 32-pounders, of different classes and weights
to suit the various circumstances. But no radical revision of
armament was made in the British navy until some years after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
the French had made the great stride of 1829, already
described.</p>

<p>Unity of calibre, then, was no novel idea on the part of
M. Paixhans. “No project,” says Dahlgren—“no project
has proved more attractive to naval men than that of having
a uniform calibre throughout the entire fleet. It has been
proposed from time to time without success, until adopted for
the French navy in 1829.</p>

<p>“In the promptness with which the example was followed by
England and the United States, may be recognized the general
convictions of the profession in regard to the serious mischief
inseparable from the chaos of calibres that prevailed, and the
urgent necessity for some measure that would simplify the
complex economy of naval ordnance.</p>

<p>“In a three-decker might be witnessed the extreme phase
of the evil: long 32-pounders, 18-pounders, and carronades,
requiring three sizes of shot and four classes of full charge, with
as many reduces as caprice might suggest. All this variety of
supply was to be distinguished and selected in the magazines
and shot-lockers—circulated with perfect exactness in the
confusion and obscurity of the lower passages, to a particular
hatchway, then up to the deck where was placed the gun for
which each charge or shot was designed: and this was to be
accomplished, not with the composure, deliberation, and
attention that the nature of the operation itself demanded, but
amid all the excitement and hot haste of battle.”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>The plans of M. Paixhans, in particular those for the
adoption of shell fire on a large scale, were viewed with much
misgiving in this country. But, as already noted, Great
Britain moved very cautiously in the counter-measures which
she took in view of the policy then under review in France.
It is probable that the publication, in 1828, of a memoir by
Captain F. A. Hastings, R.N., commanding the Greek steam
vessel of war <i>Karteria</i>, had great effect in encouraging the
authorities to countenance shell fire. From this memoir it
appears that Captain Hastings was led, by arguments similar
to those which influenced M. Paixhans, to consider the possibilities
of discharging at an enemy something more devastating
in effect than the solid sphere of iron in general use. His navy
was inferior in numbers to possible rivals; he expressed the
opinion that this inferiority might be nullified by the use of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
shell, but he “got well laughed at for his pains.” Soon afterwards,
however, he came across Paixhans’ work. Acting on
his ideas, he applied shell fire with great success in action, and
at once became an enthusiastic advocate of the new arm. One
great objection to its adoption he almost laid to rest: the
increased danger due to the carriage of shells. He denied that
there was any increased danger. On the contrary, he considered
charged shells less dangerous than powder in cartridges,
if properly packed. They were less dangerous, he argued,
because their use involved bigger and therefore fewer guns
than an ordinary ship would carry. Therefore there was less
confusion in action, less jostling, more working spaces, and
fewer cartridges and projectiles to be handled. In support of
his opinion he could point to an entire absence of accidents
during his commission in the <i>Karteria</i>.</p>

<p>In 1829 a general increase of calibre was obtained by the
inexpensive expedient of boring out guns to their next larger
calibre; in which operation the opportunity was taken to
arrange for a reduced allowance of windage for the guns thus
altered, and thus to secure a double gain, of increased calibre
and improved discharge. Experiments were made with shell
fire <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à la Paixhans</i>. Tentative designs of shell gun were
produced by the ordnance department, and guns of 8-inch,
10-inch and 12-inch calibre were made; one of which, an
8-inch, mounted in H.M.S. <i>Phœnix</i>, made very effective
shooting at San Sebastian in the year ’36 and gave thereby an
advertisement to shell fire.</p>

<p>And then, in 1837, came the French decision to adopt a
shell gun armament generally.</p>

<p>The result was a complete and corresponding reorganization
of British ship armament.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> By 1839, the authorities being at
last convinced of the necessity of meeting the French innovations
with similar innovations on our part, Colonel Munro’s
proposal of 1825 had been adopted, and various classes of ship
were equipped with six different patterns of 32-pounder long
gun. With these were associated, in small numbers, 8-inch
shell guns of fifty-three and sixty-five hundredweight. Thus
this country by a single move countered the two moves made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
by France in ’29 and ’37 respectively, and denied to M.
Paixhans, for a while at any rate, any considerable change in
the relative strength of the two navies. As in the French
navy, shell fire was only introduced as an auxiliary to the
solid shot. Thus the great ideal of unity-of-calibre, so long
sought and at last almost attained, was found incompatible
with the other ideal, shell fire; and was therefore sacrificed.
No doubt was felt, at this time, as to the necessity for two
types of gun. The superior power of shells was dreaded,
suspected, half-acknowledged; but the superior range and
penetration of solid shot fired from long guns made the latter
indispensable to ships’ equipment. So shell and large-bore
shot guns were mounted in ships side by side. Old guns and
carronades were “scrapped” in large numbers to give place to
the new ordnance; and an official announcement was made, in
justification of the Admiralty policy, that “the changes were
not made until they had been adopted by foreign powers.”</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>Shell fire was at last accepted. The perils associated with
the carriage of shells in wooden ships were found to have been
exaggerated; experience soon confirmed that, if special precautions
were taken, no danger was inherent in their use.</p>

<p>Even after its introduction into our fleets the shell gun
was regarded by many as of doubtful value. For some years
previously the opponents of shells had agitated the question
of a compromise: viz. the use of hollow shot uncharged,
instead of solid balls. And when M. Paixhans had published
his great scheme they had held that more advantages would
have been offered by it if he had stopped short at charging the
shot with powder, and had advocated merely hollow shot,
which by their larger size would give the advantages of heavier
calibre. But the argument for hollow shot was finally
demolished in 1837 by a writer whose views carried great
influence. Incorrectly attributing to M. Paixhans himself the
proposal to use them, Captain Simmons, R.A. proved clearly
and conclusively their comparative uselessness. The adoption
of hollow shot, he showed,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> would be tantamount to a reversion
to the use of stone or granite projectiles; it mattered little,
for practical purposes, what the projectile be formed of, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
its density be what was desired: whether hollow iron or solid
granite. Except the Turks, who still guarded the Dardanelles
with granite-firing cannon, all nations had abandoned granite
in favour of the heaviest metals, and no one questioned the
vast improvement thereby obtained, “except the inventors of
the carronade and the promoters of this same system, improved
by M. Paixhans.” As a matter of fact the carronade was
designed for the special circumstances in which hollow shot
were not without value. And M. Paixhans, as we know, never
intended to forego the use of a charge of powder in the cavity
of his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">boulet creux</i>. But the arguments of Simmons sufficed to
kill the advocacy of hollow, uncharged shot.</p>

<p>Doubt was cast, too, on the capacity of the shell gun to
project its shells to a sufficient range and with sufficient
striking velocity in action. In the case of the first shell guns
cast, a strict limitation had to be placed on the powder-charges
which could safely be used; and this involved a limitation of
range, apart from the reduction due to the lower specific
gravity of the projectile. Both French and English shell guns
suffered in this respect. For this reason they had been deemed
by the French specially suited for use in steam vessels, which
could by their locomotive power attain the desired range.
But, it was said, steam gives the power of avoiding, as well as
of closing to action; and steam, it was foreseen, was a
giant which would one day haul even ships-of-the-line into
position for battle. Might not future actions be fought at
considerable ranges? And for close-quarter work, could not
our powerful long guns, double-shotted, be used with greater
effect than shell guns?</p>

<p>Then, again, the flight of shells was not nearly so certain as
that of solid shot. The effects of eccentricity, which in the
case of solid shot had always militated against accurate shooting,
were in the case of shells considerably enhanced. The
varying thickness of the shell, the lack of homogeneity of the
metal, the presence of the protruding fuze, all tended to
produce eccentricity and give a bias. The centre of gravity
of a shell was seldom at its centre of figure; and this eccentricity
was the cause of deviations in flight, in range and
direction, which made the trajectory of a shell not easily
predictable. Savants and artillerists, both here and in other
countries, discussed for years these deviations, and on the
relationship between range and eccentricity numbers of trials<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
were made and theories were propounded. Which is the more
strange, seeing that Robins had placed on record an almost
complete solution. Briefly, the effect of eccentricity may be
explained as follows. Just as a stick held vertically by a thread
receives, when struck at a point in it other than the centre of
percussion, a tendency to motion not only of translation but
also of rotation round that centre of percussion; so a spherical
shell whose centre of gravity lies away from its centre of figure
receives, from the pressure of the powder gases acting at its
centre of figure, a rotary motion about its centre of gravity in
addition to a motion along the bore. If the centre of gravity lies
below the centre of figure this rotary motion is in such a direction
that, as the shell approaches the muzzle, points on its
upper surface are moving towards the muzzle, points on the
lower part are moving inwards. And this rotation, maintained
during flight, has the effect—as was demonstrated by Robins
with the musket ball—of giving the sphere a vertical deviation
in a downward direction; i.e. of reducing its range.</p>

<p>It follows, then, that an artificial increase of range could be
obtained by placing the sphere with its centre of gravity <em>above</em>
the centre of figure? This is precisely what was done; and by
many a measured eccentricity was considered a desideratum,
as giving a higher range than could be obtained without it.
With such a system, however, the deviations still remained
large and flights still more irregular. And the best opinion held
that the most satisfactory solution lay in reducing the errors of
flight as far as possible by the use of perfectly concentric shells.
This ideal was difficult of attainment. Sir Howard Douglas has
described at length experiments with shells the axis of whose
eccentricity was found by floating them in mercury: experiments
which revealed that not one shell in a hundred of those
supplied was perfectly balanced. For this reason misgiving
was felt as to the effectiveness of shell fire when carried out
at considerable ranges against solid shot, and efforts were
continuously made to correct all shell before issue.</p>

<p>Nor were the Americans inclined to view the shell gun with
much favour; remembering, doubtless, what they owed to
their long and powerful guns when they were opposed to our
light guns and carronades in the war of ’12 and ’13. America
was more cautious even than this country. But in ’41 the
8-inch shell gun appeared in American ships as an auxiliary to
the long guns: four or so on each gun deck. And four years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
later the types of guns in their ships were limited to 8-inch
shell guns, in combination with 32-pounder long guns of
various patterns; in fact, their system of armament was
assimilated to that of the French and British.</p>

<p>Whatever the relative value of shell and solid shot might be,
experience showed that increase in size favoured the former.
Though medium-sized solid shot might be more efficient than
medium-sized shells, yet it was widely accepted that large solid
shot would probably be of less value than large shell. Strong
tendencies were at work, making for such increase in the size
of artillery. It was in 1837 that a writer already quoted
showed the direction in which the arguments of M. Paixhans
were leading. Citing Sir Howard Douglas on the advantages
of large calibre and the inefficiency of random broadsides,
Captain Simmons put forward the argument that, if these
statements were accepted, it followed that all ships of war
should be armed with a few long guns of the maximum calibre
and giving the maximum muzzle energy which the ship could
safely carry, with other guns on other decks of the same calibre
but of varying weight and range. “Instead of determining
the armament of a ship from the length of her decks and
crowding as many guns together as possible; determining the
number by the extent of the battery, and subjecting their
nature to their number—making, in fact, the weight and type
of gun depend, not on the service demanded, but on the
quotient arising from dividing the total deck-weight by the
number, previously fixed on; it might be safer to place on
board a few of the most powerful guns which her construction
would admit, and then regulate the total number carried by
their aggregate weight—making the <em>number</em> and not the
<em>nature</em> of the guns depend on what is inevitably fixed: the
capacity of the vessel?”</p>

<p>The English writer went farther than M. Paixhans had gone.
His argument foreshadowed the evolution which was so
largely influenced by the coming of the steam vessel, with its
large paddle-wheels and small crew, and with its deck space
necessitating the concentration of its armament into a few
guns of the largest calibre; it foreshadowed the supersession
of the broadside by the pivot gun, and the enormous expansion
in the size of ordnance which took place after the Crimean War.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The evolution of the shell gun was at this partial stage when
the Crimean War broke out. In 1854 both types of projectiles
were still struggling for ascendancy, though large shell guns
were by this time acknowledged as the superior armament for
steam vessels. Both friend and foe were now literally
“stormed at by shot and shell”—of which the shell proved
on the whole the more effective missile. No decisive superiority
could be claimed, however, by one type over the other; and,
as we shall see later in surveying the evolution of the ironclad,
it was only gradually that the inherent superiority of the shell
gun came to be recognized.</p>

<p>Soon after the close of the war a new step in the evolution of
armament made its supremacy decisive. The rifled cannon
at last materialized. The cylinder superseded the sphere.
The increase in volume gained by the adoption of this form of
projectile, and the enhanced range and striking velocity which
it was possible to impart to it, set all doubts at rest as to the
military value of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Arme Nouvelle</i>.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE RIFLED GUN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">While</span> the evolution of smooth-bore ordnance owed
little if anything to the prior development of
small arms, the evolution of rifled ordnance which
took place in the middle of the nineteenth century followed
closely on that of rifling as applied to the musket. Experience
with the rifled musket supplied the information necessary for
the application of rifling on the larger scale. In tracing the
development of rifled ordnance, therefore, the development of
the rifled musket must first be considered: the two evolutions
are historically linked together. In this chapter an endeavour
is made to trace these two evolutions in their
natural sequence, and to describe the circumstances in which
each took place, the objects aimed at, the difficulties encountered
and the results achieved. We shall see how the
smooth-bore musket was replaced by the rifle firing a spherical
ball; how the spherical ball gave place, in the course of time, to
an elongated bullet; and how, when the elongated bullet had
been evolved, the principle of the rifle was extended to field
and to heavy ordnance. A complete survey of the whole
process can be obtained only by stepping back, past the days
of the primitive rifled fire-arm, to the age when the longbow
was still “the surety, safeguard, and continual defence of this
realm of England and an inestimable dread and terror to the
enemies of the same.”</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>The might of England, avouches the historian, stood upon
archers. The prowess of the archer, the dreadful precision of
the longbow, and the athletic arm by which it was strung, form
the constant and animated theme of ancient British story. In
battle and the chase, we are told, the power of the archers
always prevailed, and the attainment of that power was an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
object of incessant anxiety, in all ranks of people, from their
earliest infancy. The longbow was thus, as described in the
above-quoted act of Henry VIII, a continual defence of the
realm. Over all other countries England had this advantage,
that against the exigencies of war she had, not only her race of
splendid seamen, but armies of the most skilful archers in the
world. In peace she was thus well prepared. Good use was
made by legislation to maintain the skill and stimulate the
ardour of the bowmen, and the statute book bears witness,
reign after reign, to the importance attached to archery from
its military aspect. At one time every man between the ages
of fifteen and sixty had to possess a bow equal in length to his
own height. Every township had to maintain its butts, each
saint’s day had its shooting competition. The churchyard yew
gave its wood for staves, the geese on the green their best
wing feathers; and a goose’s head was the orthodox and
inconspicuous target. No man under the age of twenty-four
was allowed to shoot at any standing mark, and none over
that age at any mark of eleven score yards or under. Restraint
was laid on the exercise of sports which might interfere with
archery, and when the mechanically strung crossbow was
introduced its use was forbidden except under special
conditions.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> Honours and prizes were awarded the best
marksmen. The range and accuracy achieved by them was
without doubt prodigious. Much of their power lay in their
strength of arm; but one of the chief secrets of their craft lay
in the way in which they set their arrow-feathers at the
requisite angle to give the arrows a spin which would ensure a
long, a true and a steady flight.</p>

<p>With the advent of gunpowder the shooting competitions
declined. An embargo was put on fire-arms; instead of being
pressed to possess them the people were forbidden their use
except under conditions. The military character became a
separate order in society. Encouragement was no longer given
to the individual to own and master the unwieldy fire-arm. The
English peasant, enthusiasm evaporating as his skill declined,
no longer gave the State the military value which his forefathers
possessed. The clumsy mechanism of the English
musket, the uncertainty of its action (especially in wet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
weather), its slow rate of fire, its gross inaccuracy, and its
inability to penetrate armour under all conditions, were factors
which kept fire-arms for long years in disfavour in this country.</p>

<p>Abroad, on the other hand, the development of fire-arms
was actually encouraged and skill in their use patronised.
The rivalry which already existed with bow and arrow was
extended to the new medium, and in Sweden and Switzerland,
Germany and France, shooting competitions continued in
vogue and proficiency with musket and arquebus was honoured
and substantially rewarded. In Switzerland and Southern
Germany especially, shooting was very popular. The character
of the people, their skill in making delicate mechanisms, the
nature of the country, all tended to promote an interest in
musketry which did not exist among our own people. As a
result England has little to claim in the early stages of the
development of portable fire-arms.</p>

<p>During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries smooth-bore
weapons firing spherical lead balls were the only kind known
and used. But in the early part of the sixteenth century a
development took place which was to prove of the first
importance to fire-arms; which was to make the primitive
weapon in the course of time “the most beautiful, and at the
same time the most deadly instrument of warfare ever devised
by the ingenuity of man.” The value of rifling was discovered.</p>

<p>How, when, or where this discovery was first made, appears
to have defied the researches of investigators. As to the
manner in which the development took place and the effects
which it was intended to produce by its means there is an
assortment of evidence; and this is so various and so interesting
as bearing on the action of the rifle and its evolution, that
we reproduce it in some detail. On one point there appears to
be small doubt: <em>The earliest rifling had no twist in it</em>.</p>

<p>“It seems to have been generally accepted by writers on the
subject,” says the author of <cite>The Book of the Rifle</cite>, “that the
earliest barrels had straight grooves, the object of which was to
give a space into which the fouling of previous shots might
stow itself without obstructing the process of loading with a
well-fitting ball, and that spiral grooving was merely an
accidental variation of this, afterwards found to possess special
advantages.” Nevertheless, he himself inclines to the opinion
that the straight groove was not necessarily a prior form of the
spiral. The collections in museums contain examples of spiral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
grooving older than the oldest straight-grooved barrels. In
any case, it is antecedently more probable, he considers, that
the spiral grooving was not a variation of the straight groove,
but that it was “a deliberate attempt to find a means of giving
to the bullet the spiral spin which was well known as having a
steadying effect on the javelin, or on the arrow or bolt discharged
from the bow.”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>But in this view he is in a minority. Whereas the invention
of helical grooving is generally attributed to Augustin Kutter,
a gunmaker of Nuremburg who died in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1630, straight
grooving had been known since 1480, and is ascribed to one
Gaspard Zöllner, a gunmaker of Vienna. “Smooth-bore guns,”
says Schmidt,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> “had the disadvantage of fouling, and with the
poor powder could only be recharged by leaving a comparatively
large space between the ball and the barrel. This
windage prejudiced straight shooting. To overcome this
deficiency the practice was adopted of cutting grooves, more or
less numerous, in the barrel, and in wrapping the ball in a rag
greased with suet. In this way the windage was reduced, and
as the greased rag cleaned the barrel, the weapon could be
recharged for a large number of rounds. At first these grooves
were made straight.”</p>

<p>A theory propounded in a well-known treatise published in
the year 1808, entitled <cite>Scloppetaria</cite>, was to the effect that
grooving had its origin in the habit which the early huntsman
had of gnawing or biting the balls before putting them into the
piece, with a view to causing the wound inflicted by them to be
rendered more severe. This habit gave rise to the idea that the
barrel itself might be made to do the work of jagging or
indenting the bullet. “These grooved or sulcated barrels
appear to be of great antiquity, and are said to have existed in
Russia long before their introduction among the civilized
nations of the south.”</p>

<p>According to Hans Busk, straight grooving was adopted for
the reason given by Schmidt: i.e., purely for the purpose of
facilitating loading, and for assisting to dislodge the products
of combustion left in the bore. “No doubt the adoption of this
plan was calculated to increase the efficiency and accuracy of
the arm from the steadiness it imparted to the bullet in its
passage through the barrel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
And that is a view which, it is suggested, might be expanded
to give a motive or combination of motives which may well
have operated to induce the early gunmakers to cut grooves in
their musket-barrels. Thus: the variations in the flight of
spherical lead balls fired from smooth-bore guns were chiefly
due (though these causes were not clearly appreciated till a
much later date) to the incalculable effect of windage and to the
varying axis about which spin took place. If by any means
windage could be reduced, and if the ball could be made to
assume a central position in the bore and spin about a definite
axis in its flight, a large increase in accuracy would be attained.
Suppose, for instance, a single groove or gutter were filed along
the barrel parallel with its axis. The effect surely would be, by
creating a rush of powder-gases along this groove, to cause the
ball, under the tangential impulse of the gases, to rotate always
in the same plane as it passed through the bore. And thus by
the cutting of this single groove a uniformity of flight of the
ball would be attained which was unattainable without the
groove. The same effect, in fact, was produced by Robins when
he bent the musket barrel. He demonstrated that the result
was to make the ball roll on a definite part of the barrel and
thus to deviate during flight in a definite direction. He might
have shewn, as another result of his experiment, that by
giving the ball a uniform spin he had endowed it with a regularity
of flight, or accuracy, many times greater than it before
possessed.</p>

<p>Or suppose that, instead of one groove, two or more grooves
were filed in the same way. While the above advantage derived
from the single groove would be less fully obtained, another
would result. By providing a space on each side into which
fouling might spread, and into which the plastic metal of the
ball might be intruded by the pressure of the ramrod, their
presence would certainly allow of a tight-fitting ball being used.
The loss in efficiency of discharge due to friction between ball
and barrel would be more than compensated for by the
annihilation of windage.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
Suppose, however, that the grooves were augmented in
number until they became a series of triangular serrations all
round the interior of the barrel. The value of this formation
might lie, not so much in the grooves, as in the ends or points
of the serrations which supported the ball and held it in a
central position on the true axis of the gun. In short, the prime
idea of the gunmaker may have been, not so much the provision
of grooves, as the provision of internal ribs for holding the ball
truly in the musket.</p>

<p>Whatever the cause or motive which led to its adoption,
the rifling of musket barrels became a common practice in the
sixteenth century. Two significant quotations will suffice to
show the period of the invention. The first is an edict issued
by the Swiss Government in 1563:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“For the last few years the art of cutting grooves in the
chambers of the guns has been introduced with the object
of increasing the accuracy of fire; the disadvantage resulting
therefrom to the common marksmen has sown discord
among them. In ordinary shooting matches marksmen are
therefore forbidden under a penalty of £10 to provide themselves
with rifled arms. Everyone is nevertheless permitted
to rifle his military weapon and to compete with marksmen
armed with similar weapons for special prizes.”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The second is a recipe from a book by Sir Hugh Plat,
written in 1594.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“How to make a pistol whose barrel is two feet in length
to deliver a bullet point blank at eight score. A pistol of
the aforesaid length and being of petronel bore, or a bore
higher, having eight gutters somewhat deep in the inside
of the barrel, and the bullet a thought bigger than the bore,
and is rammed in at the first three or four inches at the
least, and after driven down with the skowring-stick, will
deliver his bullet at such distance.”</p></blockquote>

<p>So at some date not long after that at which straight
grooving was put into common practice, the evolution of the
rifle made a further advance by the introduction of spiral
grooving. This gave all the advantages of the straight
grooving, and in addition, spin in a definite plane to a definite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
degree; so that it entirely superseded straight grooving in all
countries where fire-arms were in common use. Experience
amply confirmed the superiority of the twisted rifling. With
the accession of accuracy the skill of the marksman naturally
increased, enthusiasm grew, and the shooting competitions
gained in popularity and importance. “Le goût de tir des
armes rayées de précision est poussé jusqu’à la passion:
passion qui excite l’amour-propre en ne laissant pas à la
maladresse l’excuse si facile de l’imperfection inévitable de
l’arme à canon lisse.”<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

  <div class="caption">BULLET MOULD</div></div>

<p>Yet in spite of improvements the rifled musket remained
unrecognized as a military weapon for another two hundred
years. Its use was confined to sporting purposes; though far
less in common use than the smooth-bore it became, for its
increased accuracy, the favourite weapon of the deer-stalker
and the chamois hunter. In England it was little known before
the nineteenth century; and when, in 1746, Robins made his
famous prophecy, the possibilities inherent in rifled fire-arms,
even such as were then in existence, were unrealized by the
people of this country.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that it was only in increased accuracy of
flight that the rifled gun had a superiority over the smooth-bore;
no increase in ranging power was possessed by it. And
yet this claim is constantly made by old writers, that, probably
(as they say) owing to the fact that increased resistance
of the ball to initial motion gave time for all the charge to be
thoroughly ignited, the rifled gun carried further than the
smooth-bore. As a fact, the contrary was true; other things
being equal, the range of the rifle was actually less than that
of the smooth-bore. The explanation of the paradox was
given by Robins. “It is not surprising,” he said, “that those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
habituated to the use of rifled pieces gave way to prepossessions
like these; for they found that with them they could
fire at a mark with tolerable success, though it were placed at
three or four times the distance to which the ordinary pieces
were supposed to reach: and therefore as they were ignorant
of the true cause of this variation ... it was not unnatural for
them to imagine, that the superiority in the effect of rifled
pieces was owing either to a more violent impulse at first, or
to a more easy passage through the air.” The true value of
the spiral grooving resided, of course, in the spinning motion
which it gave the ball. By making this spin uniform two
variable factors determining the trajectory were thereby
transformed into constants: first, the effect just mentioned,
the influence of the varying resistance of the air on the parts
of the ball which met it at different speeds, some parts moving
forward relatively to its centre and some parts retreating;
secondly, the effect of eccentricity of mass and irregularity of
exterior surface, which were both almost nullified by the
rotation. The importance of this second effect may not at
first sight be apparent. It must be remembered, however,
that the balls used in those days were of the roughest description;
cast in hand moulds, “drawn” in cooling to such an
extent that in a large proportion an actual cavity was left in
their interior, which could be revealed only by cutting them
open; their burrs removed with pincers, their surface rough
and broken, their shape distorted by the ramrod’s blows.</p>

<p>The superiority of the rifle in accuracy was generally
admitted; and this advantage not only counterbalanced such
deficiency in ranging power as may have accrued from the use
of grooving, but actually led to a general but mistaken belief
that the rifle carried farther than the smooth-bore. The
reverse was the case. Moreover, it was not safe to use with a
rifle the very large charges of powder which could be used
with safety with a smooth-bore musket. On account of the
resistance to motion of the ball which had been forced by
ramrod, sometimes even by mallet, down the grooved barrel
of the rifle, high chamber pressures resulted, and not infrequently
the barrels burst. Hence in spite of the thicker metal
of which they were generally made, rifles could only be used
with moderate charges, and so could not compete on equal
terms, in this respect, with the smooth-bores for superiority
of range.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
Toward the end of the eighteenth century events occurred
which drew attention to the utility of the rifle for military
purposes. In spite of its slow rate of fire—to load it carefully
took from one and a half to two minutes—it showed itself to
be a very effective weapon in the hands of French tirailleurs,
Swiss, Austrian, and Tyrolese <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Jägers</i>, Hottentots and American
Indians. In the War of Independence the superior accuracy
of their rifles, and their capacity for hitting at ranges beyond
the 200 yards which were about the limit of the smooth-bore
musket, placed the American backwoodsmen at such an
advantage over the British troops that riflemen were recruited
on the Continent and sent across the Atlantic to counter them.
New military tactics came into vogue at this time, their inception
influenced by the gradual improvement in fire-arms and
artillery. Bodies of riflemen, “a light erratic force concealing
itself with facility and forming an ambuscade at will,” were
formed in the continental armies to act in concert with the
masses of infantry as skirmishers or sharp-shooters, their object
being to surprise and demoralize the enemy by the accuracy
of their long-range shooting. Rifles were now looked on, too,
as the natural counterpart of the now flying or horse artillery,
“which, from the rapidity of its motions, the execution of
cannon-shot in all situations, appears to be the effects of little
less than magic.”<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p class="smaller">(From Ezekiel Baker’s <cite>Rifled Guns</cite>, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1813.)</p></div></div>

<p>In 1800 a rifle corps was raised by the British government
from the old 95th Regiment. As the result of competitive
trials the rifle made by Ezekiel Baker, a gunmaker of
Whitechapel, was adopted: taking spherical balls of twenty
to the pound, and having a barrel 30 inches long, rifled with
two grooves twisted one-quarter of a turn. This degree of
twist was certainly much less than that used in French, German
and American rifles, which as a rule had three-quarters or a
whole turn in them; but Baker found that so great a twist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
caused stripping of the balls; so, as the accuracy of the lower
twist was as great as that of the higher up to a range of 300
yards, and as it required a relatively smaller charge, gave
smaller chamber pressures and caused less fouling of the barrel
than its competitors, it was accepted. There was a strong
opinion at the time in favour of the larger twist as universally
used by the more expert foreign marksmen; and this opinion
was justified by experience.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> The quarter-turn twist might
give sufficient accuracy at low ranges, but as the skill of the
riflemen increased longer ranges were attempted; and then it
was found that sufficient accuracy was unattainable with the
approved weapon. Rifles having a larger twist were therefore
made by rival gunmakers and, the results of shooting matches
giving incontestable evidence of their superiority, a demand
arose for their supply to the army riflemen. Accordingly in
1839 the Brunswick rifle was adopted for the British army.
The new weapon had two deep grooves twisted a whole turn
in the length of the barrel, in which grooves studs, cast on the
ball and designed to prevent stripping, were made to engage.</p>

<p>This was the last stage of the evolution of the rifle firing a
spherical ball. So long as the spherical ball was retained, spiral
grooving offered relatively small advantages over straight
grooving; straight grooving offered small advantages over
the best smooth-bore muskets. The tedious loading of these
rifles and the inefficiency of the system by which windage was
eliminated by the force of ramming, are sufficiently set forth
by the various writers on early fire arms; and there is small
wonder that the value of rifles as military weapons was seriously
questioned by the highest professional opinion of the time.
The charge of powder had to be carefully varied according to
the state of the weather and the foulness of the piece. Care
had to be taken that all the grains of the charge poured into it
went to the breech end and did not stick to the sides of the
barrel. Patches of leather or fustian were carried, in which
the ball was wrapped on loading, to absorb windage, lubricate
the rifling, and prevent the “leading” of the barrel and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
wear which would ensue if a naked ball were used. “Place
the ball,” says Ezekiel Baker, “upon the greased patch with
the neck or castable, where it is cut off from the moulds, downwards,
as generally there is a small hole or cavity in it, which
would gather the air in its flight.” The ball, a good tight fit,
had to be rammed, in its surrounding patch, right down to the
powder: for, if not rammed properly home, an air-space
would be left and the barrel would perhaps burst on discharge;
at the least, would give an inaccurate flight to the ball. If the
barrel were at all worn, double or treble patches were necessary.
To loosen the filth which collected in the barrel, and
which sometimes prevented the ball from being either rammed
or withdrawn, water had to be poured down; not infrequently
urine was used.</p>

<p>All sizes and shapes of groove were given to the early rifle,
and their number depended largely upon caprice or superstition.
Seven, for instance, was a number frequently chosen
on account of its mystic properties; in <cite>Scloppetaria</cite> an
attempt is made to prove that an odd number has an advantage
over an even. So, also, various degrees of twist were used.
But in respect of this the evolution followed a definite course.
The pitch of the twist necessarily bore a certain relationship to
muzzle velocity. With the earliest rifles a fairly rapid twist
was given, being rendered possible by the small muzzle
velocities employed, and indeed being rendered necessary to
ensure stability to the flight of the ball. Then, with the
endeavours made, at the end of the eighteenth century, to use
higher charges and thereby to extend their range, higher muzzle
velocities came into use, and the danger of stripping was then
only prevented by the use of low twists. Special devices
enabled a return to be made, in the Brunswick and other
patterns, to the more rapid twists originally used.</p>

<p>Whatever devices were adopted to prevent stripping, however
perfect the design and material of the equipment
employed, two factors stood in the way of any further advance
in the evolution of the rifle firing the spherical ball. First, the
unsuitability of the sphere itself for projection through a
resisting medium, by reason of the large surface which it
offered to the air’s resistance and the relatively small mass by
means of which it could maintain its flight. Second, the
gyroscopic action of the spinning sphere, which limited its
effective range in a manner which was probably unrealized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
until after it had been completely superseded. The sphere,
unlike the elongated bullet, which always keeps its axis approximately
tangential to its trajectory, maintained throughout
flight its spin on its original axis. This did not matter much
when ranges were short and trajectories flat; but as greater
ranges and loftier trajectories came into use the effect on
accuracy of aim became very important. During its descent
through the latter part of the trajectory the rifle ball rotated in
a plane no longer normal to its direction of flight; “it tended
more and more to roll upon the air, and deviated considerably.”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>The old Brown Bess, the ¾-inch smooth-bore musket which
our armies carried at Waterloo, in the Peninsula, and even at
the Crimea, differed in no great respect from the muskets borne
by British troops at Ramillies, whose inefficiency was such
that it was seriously questioned whether, without the invention
of the bayonet, they would have permanently superseded the
crossbow of the Middle Ages. The inefficiency of Brown Bess
was indeed remarkable. Its standard of accuracy was so low
that a trained marksman could only depend on putting one
shot in twenty into an eighteen-foot square target at two
hundred yards, at which range it was supposed to be effective.
Its windage was so great that bullets flew wild from the muzzle;
and it is not very surprising that, armed with such a weapon,
our infantry should often have been impelled “to resort to the
strong and certain thrust of the bayonet, rather than rely for
their safety on the chance performances of the clumsy and
capricious Brown Bess.” Writers on fire-arms are able to give
dozens of tragic and laughable instances of its erratic shooting.
In the Kaffir war, for example, our troops had to expend no
fewer than eighty thousand rounds to kill or cripple some
twenty-five naked savages. After Waterloo a musket was
sent down to Woolwich, to ascertain whether its ball would
penetrate a French cuirass at two hundred yards’ range. The
cuirass was mounted on a pole, the musket aligned and held
firmly in a vice; but it was found impossible to secure a hit
until, at last, a random shot fired by one of the officers present
did take effect! Nevertheless, Brown Bess remained in favour
for a number of years after Waterloo. It had a flat and raking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
trajectory, owing to the very high muzzle velocity imparted
to it by the large charge of powder used; from its great
windage it loaded easily; and, although rather too heavy for
long marches, it was strong enough to bear any amount of
hard usage.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p>So long as the rifle used a spherical ball it could not claim to
rival Brown Bess for general service. As soon as the elongated
projectile was developed the supersession of the smooth-bore
was a matter of time alone. It is strange, however, in view of
the enthusiasm of the Victorian rifleman and the ease with
which the fire-arm lent itself to novel experiments, that the
evolution of the elongated projectile covered so long a period
as it did.</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that cylindrical bars and shot had often
been fired from ordnance, it was known that Benjamin Robins
himself had tried the experiment of firing egg-shaped projectiles
from a rifle with a certain amount of success. The inefficiency
of the loose sphere, in the case of the smooth-bore, and of the
tightly rammed sphere, in the case of the rifle, were both
recognized in the early days of the century. And, while no
solution could be found, the problem was generally agreed to
be: how to drop the projectile loosely down the barrel, and
tighten it so as to absorb the windage when already there.</p>

<p>Two or three English inventors made proposals. In 1823 a
Captain Norton, of the 34th Regiment, submitted an elongated
projectile with a base hollowed out in such a way as to
expand automatically when the pressure of the powder-gas
came on it, and thus seal the bore. The idea came to him from
an examination of the arrow used by the natives of Southern
India with their blow-tube: an examination which revealed
that the base of the arrow was formed of elastic lotus-pith,
which by its expansion against the cylindrical surface of the
tube prevented the escape of air past it. In 1836 Mr. Greener
submitted a pointed bullet having a cylindrical cavity in its
base in which a conical plug was fixed, expanding the base by a
wedging action when under the pressure of the powder gases.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>
Had either of these ideas been considered with the attention
which it deserved, the development of the rifle in this country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
might have been more rapid than it was. “By blindly rejecting
both of these inventions the authorities deprived England
of the honour of having initiated the greatest improvement in
small arms.”</p>

<p>It was in France that the elongated projectile waged an
eventually successful struggle against the spherical ball, its
ancient rival. The French, troubled by the superiority of their
Arab enemies in shooting at long range, founded a School of
Musketry at Vincennes. In 1828 Captain Delvigne, a distinguished
staff officer of that school, established the two main
principles on which all succeeding inventors were obliged to
rely: one, that in muzzle-loading rifles the projectile must slip
down the barrel with a certain windage, so as to admit of easy
loading; two, that only elongated projectiles were suited to
modern rifles.</p>

<p>Before coming to these two conclusions Delvigne had made
important efforts to render the spherical ball as efficient as
possible. He had, in particular, proposed to make that part of
the barrel near the breech which formed the powder-chamber of
slightly smaller diameter than the rest of the barrel; so that a
spherical ball, rammed down on it, became indented against
its ledge and flattened sufficiently to fill the rifling grooves.
By this device quick loading was obtained and the accuracy of
aim, it was found, was doubled. Certain practical disadvantages,
however, were associated with it: the chamber
fouled rapidly, and the ball was frequently distorted and
jagged by over-ramming. So in ’33 the Delvigne system, as it
was called, was modified by the wrapping of the ball in a
greased patch and the attaching of the patch to a “sabot” or
wad of wood which was interposed between the ball and the
shoulders of the powder-chamber. Rifles thus loaded did good
work in Algeria in ’38.</p>

<p>In the meantime Delvigne, admittedly inspired by the
writings of Robins, was urging on the authorities the superiority
of the elongated ball. He was insistent on the advantages
which would accrue from augmenting the mass of the projectile
while at the same time making it present to the air during
flight its smallest surface. The shape he proposed was that of
the present-day rifle bullet, considerably shortened: a bullet
with a flat base, cylindrical sides and ogival head, somewhat
resembling the form which had been proposed by Sir Isaac
Newton as a “solid of least resistance.” After a succession of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
disappointments and refusals, the inventor had the satisfaction
of seeing his bullet accepted. Its advantages over the
spherical ball had been made manifest on the proving-ground.
It was accepted in combination with the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carabine à tige</i>, a rifle invented by a Colonel
Thouvenin, in which the Delvigne shouldered
chamber was replaced by a small central
pillar or anvil, projecting from the breech-end
of the bore, against which the bullet
was rammed. The powder, when poured
into the barrel, collected in the annular
space around the pillar. By this arrangement
the necessity for the sabot was obviated
and the charge of powder, protected by the
pillar, was not in danger of being crushed
or mealed. In ’46 the new bullet proved
its high accuracy and ranging power on
active service in Algeria. But the pillar was
found liable to bend and distort; and the
difficulty in keeping the space round it free
from fouling proved to be another of its
inherent disadvantages.</p>

  <div class="caption">MINIÉ BULLET</div></div>

<p>And then, in 49 the Minié compound
bullet, self-expanding, of the same shape
as the Delvigne and utilizing the same principle of an expansive
bore as that embodied in Greener’s bullet, was produced.
The full value of the rifle was at last obtained. By
virtue of the elongated bullet the mass of the projectile could
be increased to a large extent without any increase in the
cross-sectional area exposed to air resistance.
With such a projectile, impelled
by a charge whose combustive
effect could be accurately gauged owing
to the absence of all windage losses, great
speed and accuracy were possible. As to
power, the only limit imposed was the strength of the barrel
and the capacity of the marksman to withstand the reactionary
blow due to the projectile’s momentum. But now, not only
was rifling advantageous: with the elongated bullet rifling
was an absolute necessity. “Rotation,” it was said, “is
the soul of the bullet.” Rotation was necessary to impart
stability, and to keep the projectile, by virtue of the initial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
spin acquired, true in its flight throughout the whole
trajectory.</p>

<p>In England, where the two-grooved Brunswick still marked
the limit of development, the discovery of the Minié weapon
and its powers occasioned misgiving and surprise.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> In ’51
some Minié rifles were purchased and issued, as a temporary
expedient, to our army. And, interest in the question now
becoming general,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> it was resolved to take under government
control the future manufacture of military small arms. A
commission of officers visited America for the purpose of
inspecting the ingenious tools and appliances known to be
employed there in the manufacture of rifles; and the features
of the various European and American weapons were seriously
studied. A government factory was established at Enfield, and
with the products of this factory certain of our regiments were
armed for service when the Crimean War broke out. The
Enfield rifle, as it was called, combined the best features of
the Minié with those of other types. It had a three-grooved
barrel with a half-turn twist in its length of 39 inches.
It was .577 inch in the bore, and fired a bullet whose
recessed base was filled with a boxwood instead of an iron
cup or plug.</p>

<p>The nation soon obtained value from the new development.
The efficiency of the Enfield rifle at the Alma and at Inkerman
was attested by the correspondent of <cite>The Times</cite>, who reported
that “it smote the enemy like a destroying angel.” Three years
later the Indian Mutiny afforded a still more conclusive proof
of the value of this weapon. Though, from the greased cartridges
which were used, it served as one of the pretexts
for the mutiny, it proved in the sequel a powerful military
instrument, and demonstrated both to friend and foe its
superiority over the smooth-bore musket with which the rebels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
were armed. In fact, with the adoption of the Enfield rifle,
England found herself in advance even of France; the French,
partly perhaps from motives of economy, partly from a desire
for symmetry, had retained in their Minié rifle the same calibre
as that of their old smooth-bore: indeed, the greater part of the
French army rifles were merely converted smooth-bores. In
the Enfield a wise reduction of calibre had been made;
whereby, while the weight of the rifle was reduced, its strength
and the size of the permissible charges, and therefore the range
and penetrating power of the projectile were all considerably
augmented.</p>

<p>Having once gained the lead, England now took another
rapid move forward in the development of the rifle. Though
the new standards set by the Enfield were high, expert opinion
aimed at something still higher; the Enfield gave variations
in range and direction which could not be accounted for by
errors in manufacture, nor did the range and penetrative power
of the bullet come up to expectations. In these circumstances
the government sought the advice of a man whose name was
destined to loom large in the story of the subsequent development
of ordnance: Mr. Whitworth. Mr. Whitworth was
described as the greatest mechanical genius in Europe at that
time. Certain it is that, although in the realm of ordnance his
name may have been overshadowed to a certain extent by that
of his great rival, yet on the broad ground of the influence his
inventions exerted on the progress of mechanical science generally,
his fame now grows with time. He it was who first swept
away the medieval conception of measurement which hitherto
had obtained in factories and workshops, and introduced a
scientific precision into the manufacture of machines and
mechanisms. The true plane surface, as we know it to-day,
was unattained before his time; and his contemporaries
marvelled at plates of metal prepared by him of so true a surface
that, by their mere adhesion, one could be lifted by means
of the other. The micrometer was a similar revelation. Men
whose minimum of size had hitherto been the thickness of a
chalk-line or a simple fraction of an inch, were taught by him
to measure the inch to its ten-thousandth part, and even to
gauge the expansion of a rod caused by the warmth imparted
by the contact of a finger.</p>

<p>Such was the man who made modern artillery possible.
To Mr. Whitworth, who knew nothing himself of guns or of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
gun-making, the government went for advice on the shortcomings
of the Enfield rifle. At their request he promptly
began an analytical inquiry into the principles underlying the
action of rifles and the flight of their projectiles, resolved and
urged to discover the secret of the very partial success so far
attained. The results of this inquiry, published in ’57, had a
great influence on the future of rifled fire-arms and ordnance.
Briefly, he discovered that the amount of twist hitherto given
to the rifling of gun-barrels had been wholly insufficient to
maintain the projectile in its true direction during flight; the
weight of the projectile, relatively to its diameter,
had been insufficient to give it the necessary momentum
to sustain its velocity against the resistance of
the air; lastly, the accuracy of manufacture of rifles
had been inadequate to the ensuring of a good fit of
the bullet in the bore. To prove the truth of these
assertions a Whitworth rifle was produced by him
which gave better results than any other hitherto
made. The form of rifling which the inventor adopted
was considered objectionable, and the rifle itself,
with its polygonal barrel, was not approved by the
authorities; but, instead, the valuable results of Whitworth’s
experiments were embodied in the Enfield, to
its obvious improvement.</p>

<p>The muzzle-loading rifle had now reached the limit of its
development. The rifle was the accepted arm of all the great
military powers. But in the case of one of them, Prussia, the
principle of breech-loading was already in favour, and it was
not long before the progress in mechanical science enabled this
principle to prove its superiority over the ancient principle of
muzzle-loading. Although in the Prussian needle-gun great
difficulties were encountered; although in service its reputation
suffered from such defects as the rusting of the needles
which pierced the percussion cartridges, the failure of springs,
the escape of gases at the breech; yet it was recognized that
none of these defects was necessarily inherent in the breech-loading
system, and its merits were admitted. With the
breech-loader a greater rapidity of fire was always attainable,
there was less difficulty in preventing fouling, and, above all,
there was the certainty that the powder-charge would be fired
to its last effective grain.</p>

<p>In 1864 breech-loading rifles were recommended for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
British army, and shortly afterwards they were introduced
in the form of converted Enfields.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>We have seen how the development of field ordnance
stimulated the development of the rifle. In turn the attainment
of superior range and accuracy by rifled small arms led
directly to a corresponding development of field ordnance,
designed to recover the loss of its ascendancy. In France,
where the logical consequences of the progress in small arms
were officially noted on several occasions, Napoleon III, himself
an authority on artillery, took the initiative to restore field
ordnance to its former relative position. It was in the Crimean
War that the enhanced effects of rifle regiments were first
seriously felt. Convinced by the protraction of the operations
before Sebastopol of the inadequacy of smooth-bore guns, the
Emperor caused bronze pieces to be rifled, and these, being
sent to Algeria on active service, gave conclusive proof of their
increased efficiency. On report of which, all the bronze field
pieces in the French army were rifled in accordance with the
plans which a M. Treuille de Beaulieu had submitted in 1842,
viz. with six shallow rounded grooves in which engaged zinc
studs carried on two bands formed on the cylindrical projectile.
The gain in power obtained by rifling ordnance was
greater even than that obtained from rifling as applied to
small arms. For not only did rifling confer the advantages of
a more massive projectile more suitably shaped for flight
through a resisting medium, but it allowed a large increase in
the number of balls which could be discharged in the form of
case or shrapnel, and a large increase in the powder-charge
which could be carried inside a common shell. An advantage
was also gained in respect of that important detail, the fusee
or fuze; the rotation of the projectile about a definite axis
made it possible to use fuses whose action depended on one
definite part of the projectile coming first in contact with the
ground or target.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> All these advantages were found to be
present in the French field pieces when rifled on the above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
plan. “And thus,” said an English writer, “at slight expense
but too late for use in the Crimean War, France was put in
possession of an artillery which, consuming its usual powder
and using either round ball or elongated projectiles, proved of
immense value in the war against Austria in 1856, when, at
Magenta and at Solferino, the case shot from their rifled
field-pieces ploughed through the distant masses of opposing
infantry and decimated the cavalry as they formed for the
attack.”<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>In England an almost simultaneous development took place,
but on entirely different lines. Let us tell it in the words of
Sir Emerson Tennant:</p>

<p>“The fate of the battle of Inkerman in November, 1854,
was decided by two eighteen-pounder guns which by almost
superhuman efforts were got up late into the field, and these,
by their superior range, were effectual in silencing the Russian
fire. Mr. William Armstrong was amongst those who perceived
that another such emergency could only be met by
imparting to field-guns the accuracy and range of the rifle;
and that the impediment of weight must be removed by
substituting forged instead of cast-iron guns. With his earliest
design for the realization of this conception, he waited on the
Secretary for War in December, 1854, to propose the enlargement
of the rifle musket to the standard of a field gun, and to
substitute elongated projectiles of lead instead of balls of cast
iron. Encouraged by the Duke of Newcastle, he put together
his first wrought-iron gun in the spring of 1855.”<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p>The manufacture of this gun marked a new era in ordnance.
Repeated trials followed its completion; with the result that
in 1858 the Armstrong gun was officially adopted for service
in the field,—the epoch-making Armstrong gun: a tube made
of wrought-iron bar coiled in a closed helix and welded at a
white heat into a solid mass; turned to a true cylinder and
reinforced by outer tubes shrunk on to it; rifled with a large
number of grooves; breech-loading, a powerful screw holding
a sliding vent-piece tightly against the face of the breech;
firing a lead-coated projectile in whose plastic covering the
rifling engaged as soon as it started its passage through the bore;
and mounted on a field-carriage in such a way that the gun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
could recoil up an inclined slide and return by gravity, and
in such a way that its motion both for elevating and for
traversing was under the accurate control given by screw
gearing.</p>

<p>The coming of the Armstrong gun at once revolutionized
artillery practice and material in this country. The sum of all
the improvements embodied in it was so great that existing
material scarcely bore comparison with it. Its accuracy as
compared with that of the smooth-bore field piece which it
displaced was stated in parliament to be in the ratio of fifty-seven
to one. And the effect of its inventor’s achievement
was, “that from being the rudest of weapons, artillery has
been advanced to be nearly on a par mechanically with the
steam engine or the power-loom; and it differs as essentially
from the old cast-iron tube dignified with the name of a gun,
as the railway train of the present day differs from the stagecoach
of our forefathers.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> A revolutionary invention it
certainly was. Yet, like most revolutionary inventions, it
relied for its grand effect more on the aggregate effect of the
small improvements in its various elements than on the
materialization of some new-born idea. The building up of
guns in coils was not a new discovery, polygroove rifling was
already in use abroad, breech-loading, lead-coated projectiles,
elevating screws—all had been known for years. Nor does
this fact detract in the least from the fame of Mr. Armstrong
in this connection. His greatness lay, surely, in the insight
and initiative with which he made use of known forms and
combinations, summoning to his aid the new powers placed at
his disposal by Whitworth, Nasmyth, Bessemer and their
contemporaries in order to evolve a system incomparably
superior to anything hitherto achieved.</p>

<p>In England, too, an independent development was at the
same time taking place in yet another direction. Mr. Whitworth,
having satisfactorily established the principles governing
the design of rifles, felt confident of extending them to field
and heavy ordnance. Adhering to the muzzle-loading principle
and to his hexagonal form of rifling he manufactured, between
the years 1854 and 1857, several guns which fired projectiles of
from six to twenty-four pounds’ weight with great accuracy and
to ranges greater than any yet attained. Events occurred
which caused him to be given every encouragement by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
government. The attitude of the French in these years was
suspicious and unfriendly. Schemes of invasion were openly
discussed in their press, and war vessels of various types
equipped with armour plate were designed and actually built.
Reports of their plans, following closely on the exposures of the
Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny, rendered the country
increasingly restless and apprehensive as to the value of our
offensive and defensive armaments. And then, although the
new Armstrong gun was acclaimed as eminently suited for
service in the field, doubts had been cast as to whether the
principles of its design could be applied satisfactorily to the
heaviest ordnance. Other rifled artillery had certainly failed to
give the results expected from it. The Lancaster rifled gun, a
muzzle-loading gun with a twisted bore of a slightly oval
section, had failed lamentably at the Crimea owing to the
tendency, according to one account, of the oval projectile to
wedge itself against the slightly larger oval of the bore; according
to another account, owing to the flames from the powder
gases penetrating the interior of the welded shells
which had been supplied for it. The breech-loading ordnance
of Cavalli had failed the Italians. In Sweden several accidents
had occurred with Wahrendorf’s breech-loading pieces. The
French system, which had been copied by the majority of the
powers, was that which appeared to be giving the least unsatisfactory
results.</p>

<p>In these circumstances every encouragement was given
Mr. Whitworth to develop ordnance on his own lines. In ’58
a committee on rifled guns was appointed by parliament to
examine and report on the relative merits of the various
systems in use. The committee quickly set to work. No
difficulty was found in eliminating all but two, on which
attention was soon concentrated: the Armstrong and the
Whitworth. The result of the final investigation was a report
in favour of the Armstrong gun, which, as we have already
seen, was adopted in the same year for field service. Mr.
Armstrong, who had handed over his rights in the gun for the
benefit of the nation, was knighted and his services were
subsidized for the improvement of rifled ordnance generally.
The title of “Engineer to the War Department” was conferred
on him, and later he received the further appointment of
“Superintendent of the Royal Gun Factory” at Woolwich.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>The revolution in field guns was closely followed by a
corresponding revolution in heavy ordnance. The experience
of the Crimean War proved two things: that the development
of the shell gun necessitated the provision of armour to
protect the flanks of warships; and that the development of
armour necessitated a heavy ordnance of a greater power than
existing smooth-bore cannon. The shell gun, in fact, induced a
rifled ordnance.</p>

<p>The French, who had already found a cheap and sufficiently
effective rifled field artillery in the conversion of their smooth-bores
on the de Beaulieu principle, merely had to extend this
conversion to their heavier pieces. By 1860 they had converted
their 30- and 50-pounder cannon in this way, thus
enabling them to be used for the discharge of either spherical
or elongated projectiles.</p>

<p>Britain, on the other hand, found herself committed to an
entirely new and experimental system which could not be
applied to existing ordnance; a large outlay of money was
thereby involved for new plant and guns; our vast establishment
of smooth-bore cast-iron cannon was in danger of being
reduced to scrap material. At the same time doubts were
expressed whether this new system, whose success as applied
to medium pieces was generally admitted, would be found
satisfactory when applied to the largest size of ordnance. It
was natural, then, that great interest should be centred in
what was regarded as a less experimental alternative to the
Armstrong system, in case the latter failed. The results
obtained by Mr. Whitworth in the manufacture of solid
cannon, rifled hexagonally, muzzle-loading and capable of
firing hexagonal bolts or, in emergency, spherical balls, were
such as to give promise of competing successfully with those
obtained from the ordnance officially patronized. To the
public the simplicity of his system strongly appealed. Mr.
Whitworth himself, far from being deterred by the decision
given in favour of his rival, was now an enthusiastic exponent
of the constructive principles which he had made his own.
Trial succeeded trial, piece after piece was made and tested to
destruction. By 1860 a very successful ordnance was evolved
at Manchester by him: guns made of homogeneous iron,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
forged in large masses, and formed of cylindrical tubes forced
one over another by means of a known hydraulic pressure—not,
as in the Armstrong system, by heating and shrinking. And
on the sands at Southport a series of public trials were carried
out with these guns, the results of which proved a great
advertisement for the Whitworth system. The accuracy of
flight of the projectiles was unprecedented, and all records in
ranging power were broken by one of the pieces, a 3-pounder,
which threw a shot to a distance of 9,688 yards!<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p>Even if the new Whitworth system were adopted, the
utilization of the old smooth-bore cannon which formed the
existing national armament of ships and fortresses was not
secured. Neither the Armstrong nor the Whitworth system
provided an expedient for converting to rifled ordnance the
thousands of cast-iron guns in which the defence of the country
was invested. Efforts were therefore made to reinforce the old
pieces so that, when rifled, they would be sufficiently strong to
withstand the greater stresses entailed. Greater stresses in the
metal, due to higher chamber pressures of the powder gases,
were almost a necessary concomitant of rifling. For, apart
from the increase in the size and mass of the projectile and its
greater initial resistance to motion, pressures tended to
increase in a greater ratio than the size of the pieces themselves;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
the mass of the projectile increased as the cube, the
propulsive force of the gases as the square, of the diameter of
the bore; hence to attain a given velocity, the larger the bore
the higher the pressure required to propel it with a given type
of powder,—other things being equal. No limit, therefore, could
be assigned to the strength and power required of heavy
ordnance. Moreover a struggle had begun in ’59, with the
building of the <i>Gloire</i> and <i>Warrior</i>, which was already foreshadowing
tremendous developments both of guns and of
armour.</p>

<p>The experiences of America in this connection were not
encouraging. The civil war served as an incentive to the
Americans to rifle all their large calibre guns as quickly as
possible. In ’62 large numbers of cast-iron cannon were rifled
and reinforced by external hoops of iron. The results were
deplorable. A great number of pieces burst; and experience
made it clear that “a gun made up of a single homogeneous
casting soon reaches a limit of resistance to internal pressure
beyond which the addition of extra metal has little or no
effect.” Two improvements must be mentioned as having
more than a passing effect on the progress of ordnance in
America: first, the adoption of compressed and perforated
powder which, by prolonging the combustion period, caused a
more even distribution of stresses over all sections of the
barrel; second, the casting of guns hollow and the chilling of
their interiors, so as to form on the inside of the piece a
hardened stratum on which the outer parts of the casting
contracted as they slowly cooled, thus giving it support. But
in spite of these inventions it became apparent that cast iron
was in its nature unsuited as a material for rifled ordnance.</p>

<p>In England a safer method of conversion was followed. Guns
were bored out, on a scheme proposed in ’63 by Major Palliser,
and accurately turned tubes of coiled wrought iron were fitted
in them, which were afterwards rifled. The resulting pieces
consisted, then, of a wrought-iron inner tube, supported by a
surrounding cast-iron jacket against which, on firing, the inner
tube expanded. Thus converted, the old smooth-bores were
enabled to develop an energy far in excess of their original
limit, and so to prolong for some years their period of usefulness.</p>

<p>The conversion of the cast-iron guns was seen to be only
a temporary expedient. Just as the smooth-bore cannon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
after a last effort to overcome iron plates with spherical solid
shot of the largest calibre, withdrew from the competition; so,
as the thickness of armour increased, the converted cast-iron
cannon, with its special armour-piercing shot of chilled iron,
soon reached the limit of its power and gave place to the rifled
artillery of wrought iron or steel.</p>

<p>And now, rifled ordnance having definitely supplanted the
smooth-bore, a new struggle arose between the various systems
of gunmaking, and more especially between the two rival
methods of loading: by the breech and by the muzzle. The
prognostications of those who had doubted whether the latter
method was suitable for large ordnance were seen to be
partially justified. Other nations had already relapsed into
muzzle-loading, impressed by the complexity and weakness of
the breech-loading systems of Cavalli, Wahrendorf and other
inventors. Besides ourselves only the Prussians, the originators
of the breech-loading rifled musket in its modern form,
continued to trust in breech-loading ordnance. The Italians,
following the example of the French and Americans, abandoned
the system. “Thus,” said an English authority in ’62, “while,
after more than four centuries of trial, other nations were giving
up the moveable breech, ... we are still going from plan to
plan in the hope of effecting what will, even if successful in
closing the breech, be scarcely safe with the heavy charges
necessary for smashing armour plates.”<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>In the following year, ’63, the committee appointed to
carry out the competitive trials between Whitworth and
Armstrong guns, reported that the many-grooved system of
rifling, with its lead-coated projectiles and complicated breech-loading
arrangements, entailing the use of tin caps for obturation
and lubricators for the rifling grooves, was far inferior
for the general purposes of war to both of the muzzle-loading
systems tried. This view received early and practical confirmation
from a report sent to the Admiralty by Vice-Admiral
Sir Augustus Kuper, after the bombardment of Kagosima. In
that action several accidents occurred owing to the Armstrong
guns being fired with their breech-blocks not properly screwed
up. The guns were accordingly withdrawn from service and
replaced by muzzle-loaders. In 1864 England reverted
definitely to muzzle-loading ordnance, which, in the face of
violent controversy and in spite of the gradual reconversion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
of her rivals to the breech-loading principle, she maintained
for the next fifteen years. Whitworth’s system was adopted
in the main, but the hexagonal form of bore and projectile was
avoided. Studded projectiles were approved, the pieces being
rifled with a few broad shallow grooves not unlike those used
by the French. England at last possessed a muzzle-loading
sea ordnance, characterized by ease and rapidity of loading,
accuracy, cheapness, and capacity for firing, in emergency,
spherical shot as well as rifled projectiles.</p>

<p>What was the effect of this retrogression upon the status of
our naval armaments?</p>

<p>It seems frequently to have been held that, in view of the
eventual victory of the breech-loading gun, the policy of
reverting to muzzle-loading was wrong, and that this country
was thereby placed at a serious disadvantage to her rivals.
Several good reasons existed, however, for the preference
given to muzzle-loading ordnance at that time. The accidents
with removable breeches had been numerous and demoralizing.
Muzzle-loading guns, besides the advantages which they
possessed of strength, solidity and simplicity of construction,
offered important advantages in ease and rapidity of loading—particularly
in the case of turret or barbette guns, where
“outside loading” was a great convenience. On the other
hand the principal deficiency of the muzzle-loader, namely,
the large windage required with studded projectiles, was now
eliminated by the invention of the cupped “gas check,” a
copper disc attached to the rear of the projectile which, on
discharge, expanded automatically and sealed the bore.</p>

<p>Expert opinion confirmed the wisdom of the government
policy. Experience, in the Franco-Prussian war and elsewhere,
confirmed the views of the experts. “Reviewing the
action of the artillerists who decided to adopt muzzle-loaders,
with the greater experience we now possess it seems that they
were right in their decision at the time it was first made; but
there was too much hesitation in coming back to breech-loaders
when new discoveries and great progress in powder
quite altered conditions.”<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> In fact, once having abandoned
the disparaged system, the country was with difficulty persuaded
by the professionals to retrace its steps. In the end,
ordnance followed small arms; the researches of Captain
Noble at Elswick proved conclusively to the world at large the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
necessity for a reversion to breech-loading; and in 1880 the
muzzle-loading gun was finally superseded by a greatly improved
form of breech-loader.</p>

<p>In 1880 the state of knowledge and the conditions under
which ordnance was manufactured were certainly altered from
those of ’64. The struggle between guns and armour begun
with the <i>Gloire</i> and <i>Warrior</i> had continued. In the presence
of the new powers of mechanical science, artillerists and shipbuilders
had sought to plumb the possibilities of offensive and
defensive elements in warship design. Guns influenced armour,
armour reacted on guns; both revolutionized contemporary
naval architecture. It was in the effort to aggrandize the power
of guns that Noble discovered that, with the existing powders
and with the short muzzle-loading gun, a natural limit of
power was soon reached. Better results could only be obtained,
he showed, by the adoption of slow-burning powder and a
longer gun; by the avoidance of the sudden high chamber
pressure which resulted from the small-grained powder, and
the substitution for it of a chamber pressure which would rise
gradually to a safe maximum and then suffer only a gradual
reduction as the gases expanded behind the moving projectile.
The work done by the gases on the projectile could by this
means be enormously increased. But, for this result, larger
powder-charges were required; and these larger charges of
slow-burning powder were found to require much larger
chambers than those embodied in existing guns; in short, the
new conditions called for a new shape of gun. Long guns,
having powder chambers of larger diameter than that of the
bore, were necessary, and these could not conveniently be
made muzzle-loading.</p>

<p>So a return to the breech-loading ordnance became inevitable,
and the change was made. The old Armstrong moveable
vent-piece was avoided, however, in the new designs; of
the two alternative breech-closing systems in use, viz. the
wedge system of Krupp and the “interrupted screw” system
of the French, the latter was adopted. A steel tube, rifled on
the polygroove system, formed the body of the piece, and this
was strengthened by hoops of iron or steel shrunk on its exterior.
The new gun yielded a very great increase of power.
Muzzle-loading guns were at once displaced, in the projected
programme of new battleships, for the new type of ordnance,
and a further series of revolutionary changes in ship armament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
at once took place. Other nations had already augmented
the length and power of their guns. By the adoption of the
improved breech-loading ordnance, Great Britain, who for the
last few years had been falling behind her rivals, not only drew
level with them but definitely took the lead in the power of
her heavy ordnance: a lead which from that time to this she
has successfully maintained.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">No</span> aspect of old naval warfare is so difficult for the
modern reader to visualize, perhaps, as that which
displays the essential weakness of the sailing warship:
its impotence in a calm. It was a creature requiring for its
activities two elements, air and water. Ruffle the sea with a
breeze, and the sailing ship had power of motion towards most
of the points of the compass; withdraw the winds, and she
lay glued to the smooth water or rolling dangerously in the
heavy swell, without power either of turning or translation.
For centuries this weakness told heavily against her and in
favour of the oar-propelled vessel, particularly in certain
latitudes. Through many years, indeed, the two types held
ascendancy each in its own waters; in the smooth stretches
of the Mediterranean the oar-driven galley, light, swift, and
using its sharp ram or bow-cannon as chief means of offence or
defence, was a deadly danger to the becalmed sailing ship; in
the rougher north Atlantic the sailing ship, strong, heavy,
capacious, and armed for attack and defence only along its
sides, proved far too fast and powerful for the oar-driven rival.
Progress—increase of size, improvement in artillery, the
development of the science of navigation—favoured the sailing
ship, so that there came at last the day when, even in the
Mediterranean, she attained ascendancy over the galley. But
always there was this inherent weakness: in a dead calm the
sailing ship lay open to attack from a quarter where her
defence lay bare. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, perhaps,
she could move sufficiently to beat off her attacker by bringing
her broadsides to bear. The hundredth, she lay at the mercy
of her adversary, who could, by choosing his range and quarter
of attack, make her temporary inferiority the occasion of
defeat. For this military reason many attempts were made
to supplement sails with oars. But oars and sails were incompatible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
They were often, seen together in early times, but
with progress the use of one became more and more irreconcilable
with the use of the other. The Tudor galleasse, though
possessing in our northern waters many advantages over the
galley type, had the defects inherent in the compromise, and
gave place in a short time to the high-charged “great ship”
propelled by sails alone. The sailing ship was by that time
strong and powerful enough to risk the one-in-a-hundred
chance of being attacked by oared galleys in a stark calm.
It was only when the first steam vessels plied English waters
that the old weakness became apparent again. It was then
seriously urged that the ship-of-the-line should carry oars once
more, against the attack of small steamers converging on her
from a weakly defended quarter.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>The oar was in many ways an objectionable form of power.
It was very vulnerable, its presence made manœuvring at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
close quarters risky and difficult; and apart from the necessity,
on which the galley service was based, of a large supply
of slave-labour for working them, oars and the rowers absorbed
a large proportion of the available inboard space, to the
detriment both of artillery and merchandise.</p>

<p>Many attempts were therefore made, not only to substitute
animals for men, for the work of propulsion, but to apply
power in a manner more suitable than by the primitive method
of levers: oars or sweeps. The paddlewheel was thought of
at a very early date; a Roman army is said to have been
transported into Sicily by boats propelled by wheels moved
by oxen, and in many old military treatises the substitution of
wheels for oars is mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> In 1588 Ramelli, engineer-in-ordinary
to the French king, published a book in which was
sketched an amphibious vehicle propelled by hand-worked
paddlewheels: “une sorte de canot automobile blindé et
percé de meurtrières pour les arquesbusiers.” In 1619 Torelli,
Governor of Malta, fitted a ship with paddles, and in it passed
through the Straits of Messina against the tide. But Richelieu,
to whom he offered his invention, was not impressed with its
value.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> Before this, Blasco de Garoy, a Spanish captain, had
exhibited to the Emperor Charles V, in 1543, an engine by
which ships of the largest size could be propelled in a calm:
an arrangement of hand-operated paddlewheels.</p>

<p>In Bourne’s <cite>Inventions and Devices</cite>, published in 1578, is the
first mention of paddlewheels (so far as we know) in any English
book. By the placing of certain wheels on the outside of the
boat, he says, and “so turning the wheels by some provision,”
the boat may be made to go. And then he proceeds to mention
the inversion of the paddlewheel, or the paddlewheel which is
driven, as distinguished from the paddlewheel which drives.
“They make a watermill in a boat, for when that it rideth at
an anker, the tide or stream will turn the wheels with great
force, and these mills are used in France,” etc. It is possible,
indeed, that this was the prior form, and that the earliest
paddlewheel was a mill and not primarily a means of propelling
the vessel.</p>

<p>Early in the seventeenth century the mechanical sciences
began to develop rapidly and as the century advanced the
flood of patents for the propulsion of ships increased. “To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
make boats, ships, and barges to go against the wind and tide”;
“the drawing and working of barges and other vessels without
the use of horses”; “for making vessels to navigate in a
straight line with all winds though contrary”; these are some
of the patents granted, the details of which are not known.
At last the ingenious Marquis of Worcester, who in 1663
was granted a patent for his steam engine, also obtained a
patent for an invention for propelling a vessel against wind
and stream. It has sometimes been inferred that this invention
was connected in some way with the steam engine, and
the claim has been made that the Marquis was one of the first
authors of steam propulsion. This is not so. Contained in the
description of the ship-propelling invention are two statements
which dispose completely of the theory that steam was the
motive force; first, that the “force of the wind or stream
causeth its (the engine’s) motion”; secondly, that “the more
rapid the stream, the faster it (the vessel) advances against
it.” From this it appears that the Marquis intended to utilize
the watermill as described by Bourne. From a study of the
description of the apparatus it has been concluded that “a
rope fastened at one end up the stream, and at the other to
the axis of waterwheels lying across the boat, and dipping
into the water so as to be turned by the wheels, would fulfil
the conditions proposed of advancing the boat faster, the more
rapid the stream; and when at anchor such wheels might have
been applied to other purposes.”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> If this reconstruction is
correct, the scope of the propelling device was very limited.</p>

<p>In Bushnell’s <cite>Compleat Shipwright</cite>, published in 1678, a proposal
was made for working oars by pivoting them at the
vessel’s side and connecting their inboard ends by longitudinal
rods operated by cranks geared to a centre-line capstan. But
the disadvantages of oars so used must have been apparent,
and there is no evidence that this invention was ever put into
practice. The obvious alternative was the paddlewheel, and
though that device had been known and used in a primitive
form long before the seventeenth century, it was continually
being reinvented (especially in the ’nineties) and tried by
inventors in various countries. Denis Papin turned his original
mind to the solution of this problem. A paper on the subject
written by him in Germany in 1690 is of interest. Discussing
the use of oars from ships’ sides he notes that, “Common oars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
could not be conveniently used in this way, and it would be
necessary to use for this purpose those of a rotary construction,
such as I remember to have seen at London. They were
affixed to a machine made by direction of Prince Rupert, and
were set in motion by horses, so as to produce a much greater
velocity than could be given by sixteen watermen to the
Royal Barge.” Papin, who had suggested the atmospheric
steam engine, also suggested the possible application of steam
to propulsion. But it was left to others to achieve what he
had to propose. His talent, it has been said, lay rather in
speculations on ingenious combinations, than in the mechanical
power of carrying them into execution on a great scale. In
1708 he laid before the Royal Society, accompanied by a letter
of recommendation from Leibnitz, a definite proposal for a
boat “to be moved with oars by heat ... by an engine after
the manner that has been practised at Cassel.” What form
this engine was to take, and how the power was to be transmitted
to the oars, is still a matter of conjecture. Only this is
known, that the proposal was considered in detail by the
president, Sir Isaac Newton, and that on his advice no further
action was taken.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></p>

<p>In France it has been widely claimed that Papin actually
engined a boat and propelled it over the waters of the Weser
by the force of steam. His biographer states that on the 24th
September, 1707, Papin “embarquait sur le premier bateau à
vapeur toute sa fortune.”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> But the statement is not correct.
The misconception, like that which assigned to the Marquis of
Worcester the invention of a steam-propelled vessel, was
doubtless due to the fact that the inventor was known to be
engaged in the study of the steam engine and of ship-propelling
mechanism. The two things, though distinct in themselves,
were readily combined in the minds of his admirers. It is
generally agreed to-day, we think, even by his own countrymen,
that Papin, though he may claim the honour of having
first suggested the application of steam to ship propulsion,
never himself achieved a practical success.</p>

<p>In the meantime Savery in England had produced his
successful engine. In his case, too, the claim has been made
that he first proposed steam propulsion for ships. But in his
<cite>Miner’s Friend</cite> this able mechanician showed that he recognized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
the limited application of his steam engine. “I believe,” he
says, “it may be made very <em>useful</em> to ships, but I dare not
meddle with that matter; and leave it to the judgment of
those who are the best judges of maritime affairs.” But in
propulsion by hand-operated paddlewheels Savery was an
enthusiastic believer. In 1698 he had published, in a book
bearing the title, “<cite>Navigation Improv’d: Or the Art of Rowing
Ships of all Rates, in Calms, with a more easy, swift, and
steady Motion than Oars can</cite>,” a description of a mechanism
consisting of paddlewheels formed of oars fitted radially to
drumheads which were mounted on the two ends of an iron
bar placed horizontally across the ship. This bar was geared
by mortice wheels with another bar mounted vertically as
the axis of a capstan; rotation of the capstan was thus transmitted
to the paddlewheels. Savery fitted this mechanism to
a wherry and carried out successful trials on the Thames
before thousands of people. But the Navy Board would not
consider it. They had incurred a loss, it appeared, on a horse
tow-vessel which had been in use at Chatham a few years
previously: a vessel which towed the greatest ships with the
help of four, six, or eight horses, and which, incidentally, may
have influenced Savery in adopting the term “horse power”
as the unit of work for his steam engine. The sanguine inventor
made great efforts to interest the authorities, but without
avail; the Surveyor rejected the proposal. So in an angry
mood Savery published his book, with a description of his
mechanism and an account of his efforts to interest the authorities,
to show how one man’s humour had obstructed his engine.
“You see, Reader, what to trust to,” he concluded, “though
you have found out an improvement as great to shipping as
turning to windward, or the compass; unless you can sit
round the green table in Crutched Friars, your invention is
damned of course.”</p>

<p>The first detailed scheme for applying steam-power to ship
propulsion was contained in the patent of Jonathan Hulls, in
1736. Though great credit is generally given to this inventor
(who has even been dubbed the father of steam navigation), it
does not appear that in reality he contributed much to the
advancement of the problem; which was, indeed, still waiting
on the development of the steam engine. Hulls’ notion,
explained in a pamphlet which he published in 1737, was to
connect the piston of a Newcomen engine by a rope gearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
with some wheels mounted in the waist of the vessel, which
wheels oscillated as the piston moved up and down. These
wheels were in turn connected by rope gearing with a large
fan-wheel mounted in a frame rigged out over the vessel’s
stern, the fans in their lowest position dipping into the water.
The oscillating motion of the inboard wheels was converted
into a continuous ahead motion of the fan-wheel by means
of a ratchet. With this machinery he designed to tow
ships in harbours and rivers. It must, however, be remarked
that the invention was never more than a paper
project; and that if Hulls had tried to translate his ideas
into three dimensions he would have encountered, in all
probability, insuperable practical difficulties. One very
original suggestion of his certainly deserves notice; as a
special case he proposed that when the tow-boat was used in
shallow rivers two cranks, fitted to the axis of his driving
wheels, should operate two long poles of sufficient length to
reach the bottom of the river; these trailing poles, moving
alternately forward, would propel the vessel. Here is an early
application of the crank. But in this case it will be noted that
the crank is driven, and that it converts a rotary into a reciprocating
motion; in short, it is an inversion of the driving crank
which, as applied to the steam engine, was not invented till
some years later.</p>

<p>As before remarked, the whole problem of steam propulsion
waited upon the development of the steam engine. In the
meantime the application of convenient forms of man power
received considerable study, especially in France. In Bouguer’s
<cite>Traité du Navire</cite> the problem was investigated of propulsion
by blades or panels, hinged, and folding when not in use
against the vessel’s sides; and in 1753 the prize offered by the
Academy of Sciences for an essay on the subject was won by
Daniel Bernouilli, for a plan on those lines. Euler proposed
paddlewheels on a transverse shaft geared like Savery’s, by
mortice wheels to a multiple capstan. Variations of this
method were proposed by other writers and inventors, and
some of the best intellects in France attacked the problem. But
nothing definite resulted. The most valuable result of the
discussion was the conclusion drawn by M. Gautier, a professor
of mathematics at Nancy, that the strength of the crew was
not sufficient to give any great velocity to a ship. He proposed,
therefore, as the only means of attaining that object, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
employment of a steam engine, and pointed out several ways
in which it might be applied to produce a rotary motion.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></p>

<p>In the course of time the problem marched forward to a
solution. The first great improvement in the steam engine
which rendered it adaptable to marine use was the invention
by Watt of the “double impulse”; the second, Pickard’s
invention of the crank and connecting-rod. By virtue of these
two developments the steam engine was made capable of imparting
to a shaft a continuous rotary motion without the
medium of noisy, brittle or inefficient gearing. As soon as
engines having this power were placed on the public market
attempts were made to mount them in boats and larger
vessels; steam navigation was discerned as a possibility.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>Of the many efforts which were made at the end of the
eighteenth century to apply steam power to the propulsion of
ships a striking feature is their complete independence from
each other and from the results of prior experience and
research. Little information is available as to the results of
various experiments which were known to be carried on in
France at this time, and, with all respect, it is improbable that
they contributed in any way to the subsequent evolution of the
steam vessel. The Abbé Darnal in 1781, M. de Jouffroi in 1782,
and M. Desblancs in 1802 and 1803, proposed or constructed
steamboats. M. de Jouffroi is said to have made several
successful attempts on the Saone at Lyons; but the intervention
of the Revolution put an end to his undertakings.</p>

<p>In Britain a successful attempt to apply the steam engine
to the paddlewheel was made in 1788. In that year three
men, combining initiative, financial resource, and a large
measure of engineering ingenuity, proved the possibility of
steam propulsion in an experiment singularly complete and of
singularly little effect on subsequent progress. In the summer
of ’87 a wealthy and inventive banker, Mr. Patrick Miller of
Dalswinton, Edinburgh, had been making experiments in the
Firth of Forth with a double vessel of his own invention, sixty
feet long, which, when wind failed for sailing, was set in motion
by two paddlewheels. These paddlewheels were fitted between
the two hulls of the vessel and were worked by men, by means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
of a geared capstan. Miller believed that a boat furnished with
paddlewheels and worked manually would be of great
advantage for working in shallow rivers and canals. But the
result of a sailing race between his boat and a custom-house
wherry of Leith, in which his own sails were supplemented by the
labours of four men at the wheels, convinced him that manpower
was insufficient. His sons’ tutor, a Mr. Taylor, suggested
the application of a steam engine. And being acquainted
with an engineer named Symington, Taylor prevailed on his
patron to engage him to mount a one-horse-power engine in
a double pleasure boat, upon the lake at Dalswinton. The
experiment was a complete success. “The vessel moved
delightfully, and notwithstanding the smallness of the cylinder
(4 inches diameter), at the rate of 5 miles an hour. After
amusing ourselves a few days the engine was removed and
carried into the house, where it remained as a piece of ornamental
furniture for a number of years.”<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> Determined to
pursue the experiment, Miller ordered a replica of the original
engine on a larger scale, and this engine, with a cylinder of
18 inches diameter, was erected at Carron and fitted to a
larger boat. This also was successful. But no further trials
were made after ’89; for Patrick Miller, who had spent a large
sum in order to establish the feasibility of the invention, decided
to close his investigations, and to turn to other pursuits.</p>

<p>No further attempt was made in Great Britain until 1801,
when Lord Dundas engaged Symington to make a series of
experiments on the substitution of steam power for horse
towage of barges on the Forth and Clyde canal: experiments
which resulted in the <i>Charlotte Dundas</i>. In this celebrated
vessel a double-acting Watt engine, with its 22-inch
diameter cylinder mounted horizontally on the deck, actuated,
through a simple connecting-rod and a crank with a 4-foot
throw, a paddlewheel which was carried in a centre-line recess
at the stern. In March, ’03, Symington in the <i>Charlotte
Dundas</i> towed two 70-ton vessels nineteen miles against a
strong head wind in six hours. Success seemed assured to him.
His reputation was already high, and now an invitation came
from the Duke of Bridgewater for eight similar tow-boats to
ply on his canal. But the inventor’s hopes were disappointed.
The Duke died suddenly, and the governing body of the Forth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
and Clyde canal vetoed the further use of steam vessels for fear
of the damage the waves might cause the banks. Other bodies
took the same view, and thus came to an end an important
passage in the history of steam navigation. It is remarkable,
considering the efforts which had been made by inventors from
the sixteenth century onwards to improve on oar-propulsion
for military purposes, that Miller, Symington, and their friends
do not seem to have envisaged any use for steamboats other
than as tugs on canals. It is remarkable that in the presence of
this initial success neither the government nor the public
showed any realization of the possibilities which it unfolded;
that no attempt was made by commercial enterprise—even if,
in the realm of naval strategy, such an innovation was regarded
as impolitic or impracticable<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>—to develop its advantages and
to secure an undisputed lead in the new application of steam
power.</p>

<p>It was in America that the most persistent and continuous
development took place, quite independently of efforts elsewhere
and almost contemporaneously with those above
described. America, whose geographical conditions made
water transport relatively far more important than it was in
Great Britain, lent a ready ear to the schemes of inventors. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
1784 James Rumsey, and shortly afterwards John Fitch, had
already laid plans before General Washington for the propulsion
of boats by steam.</p>

<p>John Fitch, whose original idea was a steamboat propelled
by means of an endless chain of flat boards, afterwards experimented
with an arrangement, “borrowed no doubt from the
action of Indians in a canoe,” of paddles held vertically in
frames mounted along the sides of the boat and operated by
cranks. In 1786 a boat thus equipped made a successful trial
on the Delaware, and in the following year a larger boat, fitted
with a horizontal double-acting engine with a 12-inch cylinder
and a 3-foot stroke, giving motion to six paddles on each side,
was publicly tried on the same river. The speed attained was
very small. At last in 1790, still protected by a patent which
granted him a temporary monopoly in steamboat building,
Fitch succeeded in building a boat which was an undisputed
mechanical success. Discarding the paddle-frame and adopting
a beam engine to drive paddle-boards at the stern, he produced
a steamboat which, after being tested and credited with eight
knots’ speed on a measured mile in front of Water Street,
Philadelphia, in the presence of the governor and council of
Pennsylvania, ran two or three thousand miles as a passenger
boat on the Delaware before being dismantled. It was a considerable
achievement. But the excessive weight and space
absorbed by the machinery prevented the boat from being
a financial success; and, after a journey to France, then
distracted by the Revolution, Fitch returned home to America
and ended his days a disappointed and a broken man.
Nevertheless, the work he did was of service to others. He
proved that the ponderous nature of the machinery was the
greatest obstacle to the propulsion of small craft by steam,
and from his failure deduced the conclusion, on which later
inventors were able to build, that the solution of the problem
lay in the <em>scale</em>: that, “it would be much easier to carry a
first-rate man-of-war by steam at an equal rate than a small
boat.”<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>James Rumsey, a Virginian, carried out in 1775 the first
practical trials of water-jet propulsion, a small boat of his
plying the Potomac at a small speed by means of a steam pump
which sucked in water at the bow and threw it out at the stern.
But as he felt himself obstructed in further experiments by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
patent rights which had been given his rival Fitch he came to
England; where, financed by a wealthy compatriot and aided
by James Watt himself, he produced in ’93 a boat which on the
Thames attained a speed of over four knots. Unfortunately
Rumsey died in the middle of his experiments.</p>

<p>An individual of extraordinary qualities had now turned his
attention to the problem of steam propulsion. In that same
year a young American artist, Robert Fulton, who had come to
England to work under the guidance of his countryman
Benjamin West, wrote to Lord Stanhope informing him of a
plan which he had formed for moving ships by steam. Lord
Stanhope, well known as a scientific inventor, had recently
been experimenting with a vessel fitted with a 12-horse-power
engine of Boulton and Watt’s working a propeller which
operated like the foot of an aquatic bird. A correspondence
ensued. Fulton, whose self-confidence equalled his originality,
illustrated by drawings and diagrams his ideas on the
subject. At first, he said, he thought of applying the force of
an engine to an oar or paddle which, hinged on the counter at
the stern, by a reciprocating motion would urge the vessel
ahead. But on experimenting with a clockwork model he
found that, though the boat sprang forward, the return stroke
of the paddle interfered with the continuity of the motion.
“I then endeavoured,” he wrote, “to give it a circular motion,
which I effected by applying two paddles on an axis. Then the
boat moved by jerks; there was too great a space between the
strokes. I then applied three paddles, forming an equilateral
triangle to which I gave a circular motion.” These paddles he
proposed to place in cast-iron wheels one on each side of the
boat and mounted on the same shaft at some height over the
waterline, so that each wheel would “answer as a fly and brace
to the perpendicular oars.” And he stated that he found, from
his experiments with models, that three or six oars gave better
results than any other number. From which it is clear that the
paddlewheel was evolved by Fulton from the simple paddle
independently of suggestion received from previous inventors.</p>

<p>Some time was to elapse before the results of his experiments
were utilized. Attracted by the boom in canal construction
then in vogue Fulton devoted his mind to that
subject; though in this connection the idea of steam-propelled
boats still occupied him, as is shown by a letter he wrote in ’94
to Messrs. Boulton and Watt, asking for an estimate of costs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
and dimensions of “an engine with a rotative movement of the
purchase of 3 or 4 horses which is designed to be placed in a
boat.” From England he went to Paris, to try his fortune at
half a dozen projects. In ’98 he was experimenting on the
Seine with a screw propeller—“a fly of four parts similar to
that of a smoke-jack,” which gave promising results. This
screw propeller, however, was as yet unrecognized as the
propulsive medium of the future. It had already been patented
in England by Bramah in 1785—“a wheel with inclined fans, or
wings, similar to the fly of a smoke-jack or the vertical sails of a
windmill”; and, hand-operated, it had actually been used in
America in 1776 by Bushnell in connection with his submarine.
But in 1802 Fulton had decided against the screw, and in
favour of the paddlewheel.</p>

<p>It was in this year that an introduction to an influential
compatriot, himself an experimenter in steam propulsion, gave
Fulton the opportunity to display his talents to their mutual
advantage. Chancellor Livingston, U.S. Minister to France,
was aware of the enormous advantages which would accrue to
America (and to the happy inventor) if steam propulsion could
be achieved economically. With Fulton’s aid he decided on
building an experimental steam vessel in France, with a view
to transferring to America for commercial enterprise the
perfected results of their labour. A partnership was formed,
the work proceeded; but the experimental steamboat, whose
scantlings were unequal to supporting the weight of the 8-horsepower
machinery placed on board, sank at her moorings in a
storm. A second boat, stronger and bigger, attained complete
success. Fulton promptly wrote to Messrs. Boulton and Watt
asking them to export to America a 24-horse-power engine
complete with all accessories, in accordance with his sketches;
and with a brass air-pump suitable for working in salt water.
Then, going himself to England, he visited Messrs. Boulton and
Watt and gleaned what information he could as to the
properties of their machinery; studied the newly published
results of Colonel Beaufoy’s experiments on ship form and
fluid resistance; and journeyed to Scotland to visit Symington
and see the famous <i>Charlotte Dundas</i>.</p>

<p>Armed with this knowledge, with all the experience of
Rumsey and Fitch, and with the data from his own trials,
Fulton brought to a successful solution the problem of
steam propulsion on a commercial scale. It has been remarked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
that there was no element in the <i>Clermont</i> or her
successors so original in conception that it would entitle
Fulton to be regarded as the inventor of steam navigation.
Nor did he himself claim to be such. He was successful
in fitting together the elements, the inventions of others.
Science is measurement, and Fulton applied his data and
measured with great insight, adapting his elements in the
right manner and proportion to form an efficient whole. “He
was the first to treat the elementary factors in steamship
design—dimensions, form, horse-power, speed, etc.—in a
scientific spirit; to him belongs the credit of having coupled
the boat and engine as a working unit.” From Fitch he had
learned the economy of size, and the advantages of enlarging
the scale of operations; from Beaufoy, the importance of a
fair underwater form, with a sharp bow and stern. From
Symington, who generously took him for a trip in the <i>Charlotte
Dundas</i>, he could not fail to have gleaned much practical
advice and information; it is remarkable, in this connection,
that, after a sight of Symington’s horizontal cylinder with its
simple connecting-rod drive to the stern wheel, he should have
adhered to the vertical cylinder and the bell-crank or beam for
the transmission of the force: an initial divergence which was
perpetuated, and which became the hall-mark distinguishing
American from English practice for some years to come.
Most of his knowledge he gained by his activities in England,
and many writers have contested a claim—which so far as is
known was never made by him—to the invention of the steamship.
His achievements were well defined and legitimately
executed, and the remarkable insight and initiative which he
displayed in adapting the labours of others to serve his own
utilitarian ends cannot, surely, deserve the opprobrium cast on
them by some of the nineteenth-century writers. Prometheus,
it is said, stole fire from heaven. Fulton bought his in the open
market; obtaining his engine in Soho and his boiler in Smithfield
he transported them across the Atlantic, and in 1807
produced the <i>Clermont</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Clermont</i>, a flat-bottomed wall-sided craft 166 feet in
length and only 18 feet in beam, steamed at a speed of five
knots from New York to Albany, in August, 1807; to the
surprise of thousands of spectators who knew her as “Fulton’s
folly,” and whose shouts of derision gave place to silence, and
then to a chorus of applause and congratulation. Many of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
inhabitants of the banks of the Hudson had never heard even
of an engine, much less of a steamboat. “A monster moving
on the waters, defying the winds and tide, and breathing flames
and smoke! The first steamboat used dry pine wood for fuel,
which sends forth a column of ignited vapour many feet above
the flue, and, whenever the fire is stirred, a galaxy of sparks fly
off which, in the night, have a very brilliant and beautiful
appearance.”<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> The <i>Clermont</i> was followed by others, each an
improvement on the last; until in 1816, so rapid was the
process of evolution, the <i>Chancellor Livingston</i> was built,
ship-shaped, with figure-head and fine bows, faired sides and
tapering stern, with engines of 75-horse-power and with
promenade decks and accommodation for 120 passengers.
Certain characteristics now showed themselves in all American
construction. The engines were mounted with cylinders
vertical, their rods actuating large overhead beams which
transmitted the force of the steam to the paddlewheels. The
boats were made very broad to give the necessary stability, the
machinery being carried high; and to reduce their underwater
resistance as much as possible their bodies were made full
near the water-line and lean below. For the same reason, and
since the principal weights were concentrated amidships, fine
forward and after bodies were given them; a rising floor, and a
deep draught if necessary. The position of the paddlewheels
was limited by that of the engine. Experience showed that
where two paddles on each side were used their relative
position had to be adjusted nicely, otherwise the rear paddles,
acting on accelerated water, might actually be a disadvantage.
Much difficulty was caused with accidents to paddles; on the
Mississippi the wheels were generally mounted astern, where
they were protected from floating logs of timber. In some
cases double hulls were built, with the paddlewheels between
them; but owing to the rush of water on which they acted
these wheels were not very efficient.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<p>Fulton had so far built steam vessels only for commercial
traffic. He now came near to revolutionizing naval warfare
with them. In 1813, in the middle of the war with this country,
he presented to the President his plan for a steam-propelled
armoured warship for coast defence, a design of an invulnerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
vessel of thirty guns, twin-hulled, with a 120-horse-power engine
in one hull, a boiler in the other, and a single paddlewheel in a
space between the two; double-ended, flat-bottomed, and
protected by a belt of solid timber 58 inches thick. Her
armament was to consist, in addition to thirty 32-pounders, of
submarine guns or columbiads, carried at each end and firing
100-pound projectiles below the water-line. Named the
<i>Demologos</i>, this monstrous vessel was nearly completed when
the war came to an end. It was too late for use. The treaty of
Ghent being signed, interest in armaments immediately evaporated.
Nevertheless, in the following year a trial of the
<i>Demologos</i> was carried out, which showed that a speed of five
and a half knots could be attained with her. The <i>Demologos</i>,
now renamed the <i>Fulton</i>, served no useful purpose. She was
laid up in Brooklyn Navy Yard, and many years elapsed before
steam war vessels were built again in America.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>In the meantime progress had been made on this side of the
Atlantic. Stimulated by Fulton’s commercial successes,
Thomas Bell of Helensburgh built in 1812 a vessel of thirty tons’
burden named the <i>Comet</i>, successfully propelled by a 3-horse-power
engine which worked a paddlewheel on each beam.
This “handsome vessel” was intended to ply between Glasgow
and Greenock, to sail by the power of wind, air, and steam;
and so it did, with fair financial success, with a square sail
triced to the top of a tall smoke-stack: the first passenger
steamer to ply in European waters. Shortly afterwards steam
vessels were built which pushed out to the open sea. In 1815
the <i>Argyle</i>, built on the Clyde and renamed <i>Thames</i> on being
purchased by a London company, made a voyage from
Greenock to London which was the subject of much comment.
On making the Cornish coast after a stormy run south, boats
were seen by those on board making towards her with all
possible speed in the belief that she was on fire! All the rocks
commanding St. Ives were covered with spectators as she
entered the harbour, and the aspect of the vessel, we are told,
“appeared to occasion as much surprise amongst the inhabitants,
as the ships of Captain Cook must have produced on his
first appearance among the islands of the South Seas.” Next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
day the <i>Thames</i>, her 9-foot paddlewheels driven by a 16-horse-power
engine, reached Plymouth, where the crews of all the
vessels in the Sound filled the rigging, and the harbour-master
was “struck with astonishment.” From Plymouth she
steamed to Portsmouth, making the passage in twenty-three
hours. So great was the swarm of vessels that crowded round
her, that the port admiral was asked to send a guard to
preserve order. She steamed into harbour, with wind and tide,
at from twelve to fourteen knots. A court-martial was sitting
in the <i>Gladiator</i> frigate, but the whole court except the
president adjourned to inspect the strange visitor. Next day
the port admiral sent off a guard and band; and soon afterwards
he followed, accompanied by three admirals, eighteen
post captains, and a large number of ladies.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<p>The success of the <i>Thames</i> led to the immediate building of
other and larger steamers. In ’17 the son of James Watt
purchased a 94-foot boat, the <i>Caledonia</i>, fitted her with
28-horse-power machinery driving 10-foot paddlewheels, and
for a pleasure trip proceeded in her up the Rhine as far as
Coblentz. From this time onwards steam navigation for
commercial purposes progressed rapidly. In 1818 a steamboat
made regular voyages at sea; the <i>Rob Roy</i>, 90 tons, built by
Denny of Dumbarton, with engines of 30 horse-power made
by Napier, plied regularly between Holyhead and Dublin. In
the same year the <i>Savannah</i>, a ship of 350 tons’ burden built
and fitted with auxiliary steam machinery at New York,
crossed the Atlantic, partly under steam; her paddlewheels
with their cast-iron frame and axletree successfully withstanding
heavy weather. In ’21 the postmaster-general introduced
a steam service for the mails at Dover and Holyhead; and in
the following year there were steamboats running between
London and Leith, and other seaports. The experience of the
Holyhead packets was of special value, as it proved that
steam vessels could go to sea in weather which would keep
sailing vessels in harbour. Soon after this the question was
raised of employing steam power to shorten the passage between
England and the East, as well as of the navigation by steam of
the great Indian rivers. Steam superseded sails in the government
mail service between Falmouth, Malta and Corfu;
everywhere commercial enterprise was planning new lines of
steamships and new possibilities of ocean travel. In ’25 a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
barque belonging to Mr. Pelham, afterwards Earl of Yarborough,
was fitted with steam machinery as an auxiliary and
made the voyage to India. The plash of the paddlewheel was
then heard for the first time in Oriental waters.</p>

<p>By this time the great question of steam as applied to
naval ends had arrived to agitate the Admiralty.</p>

<p>In ’22 M. Paixhans discharged his revolutionary treatise at
the French nation, advocating, with a wealth of argument, a
navy of steam-propelled warships armed with a few shell
guns. Six years later a warning echo reverberated through
Whitehall. Captain Sir John Ross published a volume on
“Steam Navigation, with a System of the Naval Tactics
peculiar to it,” in which, though his name was not mentioned,
the arguments of M. Paixhans were set forth from an opposite
point of view. The two books, starting with the same
arguments, arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions.
While Paixhans claimed that steam power offered important
advantages to France, the English writer reached the gratifying
conclusion that the change which steam would effect in naval
affairs might be rendered favourable to this country. For
coast defence alone steam vessels would be invaluable. The
colonies would be safer from piracy. Passages, at present
difficult or dangerous, would be made with speed and safety.
Incidentally, an entirely new system of tactics would be evolved
by the coming of steam; each ship-of-the-line would be
escorted by a steam vessel, to tow her into position, and
concentration of force would be obtained by such means as,
harnessing two steamers to one sailing ship, so as to tow one
half of the fleet to a position of vantage over the enemy. After
the main action the steamers would themselves attack each
other; and so on. Both French and English writers agreed
that there would be a reversion to the ancient warfare of the
galleys; the steamer, whose paddlewheels lent themselves
readily to a pivot gun armament and to great powers of
manœuvring, would always attack like a bull, facing the
enemy, its bows presenting one or more large and well-protected
cannon. Sir John Ross regarded the steamer, however,
essentially as an auxiliary. M. Paixhans took a more sanguine
view. “At this moment,” he wrote in May, ’22, “the English
admiralty are building two steam vessels, each of thirty horsepower,
one at Portsmouth and one at Plymouth, for tugging
sailing ships held up by contrary winds. They commence by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
being the servitors of the ships-of-the-line; but it is their
destiny to become their masters.”<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<p>But the views of Sir John Ross did not find favour at the
Admiralty. In the presence of the revolution the authorities
continued to steer a policy of passive resistance to all changes
and methods which might have the effect of depreciating existing
naval material; and Lord Melville himself penned, as a reply
to the Colonial Office to a request for a steam mail service
between two Mediterranean ports, the principle which guided
the Board. They felt it their bounden duty (he wrote in 1828)
to discourage, to the utmost of their ability, the employment
of steam vessels, as they considered that the introduction of
steam was calculated to strike a fatal blow at the naval
supremacy of the Empire.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a><a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<p>So far, then, new methods of propulsion had not been greeted
with enthusiasm. Yet to the First Lord himself was due the
utilization of steam for minor purposes in the navy. In spite of
the non-success of Lord Stanhope’s experimental “ambi-navigator”
ship in 1795, Lord Melville in 1815 caused the
three-masted schooner <i>Congo</i>, designed for a surveying
expedition to the river of that name, to be fitted with paddlewheels
and machinery by Boulton and Watt, expressly to try
it in a ship-of-war. This machinery was so large and ponderous
that, not only did it usurp one-third of the space aboard
the ship, but brought her down so deep as only to give four
knots through the water. It was all removed again before she
sailed, and sent to Chatham for use in the dockyard. In the
following year we find Mr. Brunel in correspondence with his
lordship on the question of steam navigation. Brunel wrote
quoting evidence to the effect that paddlewheels could be made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
of sufficient strength and stiffness to withstand the violence of
seas and gales; to which Lord Melville replied that the Board
deemed it unnecessary to enter, at that time, into the question
of steam navigation generally, but desired his views on the
application of steam to the towing of ships-of-war out of
harbour against contrary winds and tides: which would be a
matter of great advantage to his Majesty’s service. Brunel
answered recommending that the steamer <i>Regent</i>, plying
between Margate and London, be chartered during the
winter and employed on this work, as a particular experiment.</p>

<p>“From this period may be dated the introduction of steam
navigation into the English navy. Lord Melville was now so
fully convinced of the great utility which the naval service
would derive from it, that he ordered a small vessel to be built
at Deptford, by Mr. Oliver Lang, to be called the <i>Comet</i>, of the
burthen of 238 tons, and to have engines of 80 horse-power.
She was built accordingly and ready for sea in 1822.”<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> As a
matter of fact, the first steamer actually brought into H.M.
service was the <i>Monkey</i>, built at Rotherhithe in 1821; and she
was followed by the more powerful <i>Sprightly</i>, built at Blackwall
by Messrs. Wigram and Green in ’23. Gradually the use of
these paddlewheel tugs extended, their tonnage and horse-power
increased, and the Surveyor of the Navy and his master
shipwrights began to divert their talents to a consideration of
the small steamers.</p>

<p>For the reason stated by Lord Melville, steamers were at this
time tolerated only for towing and other subsidiary duties;
authority poured cold water on the idea of utilizing them as
ships-of-war; and if steam could have been dispensed with
altogether, everyone would have been the better pleased.</p>

<p>Even at this period the idea of using manual labour, applied
in an effective manner, for towing and bringing into position
sailing warships had not been altogether abandoned. In 1802
the transport <i>Doncaster</i> had been propelled at a slow speed in
Malta harbour by the invention of a Mr. Shorter: a screw
propeller rigged over the stern. In 1820 experiments were
made at Portsmouth with paddlewheels manually worked, and
in ’29 Captain C. Napier took his ship <i>Galatea</i> out of Portsmouth
Harbour by use of paddlewheels geared to winches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
which were worked by the crew. One hundred and thirty men
were able to give her a speed of 2½ knots, while the full crew
of a hundred and ninety produced a speed of three. After
this doubtful success another trial was held—a race between
the <i>Galatea</i>, propelled by paddles, and the <i>Briton</i>, towed by
boats—which <i>Galatea</i> won. Captain Napier’s paddlewheels
afterwards did good work for his ship in other quarters of the
world.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> Nothing resulted, however, from his initiative in this
connection; only was emphasized the enormous superiority
of steam-propelled vessels as tugs, in which capacity they had
already made their appearance, and from which they were
destined to evolve, in the next decade, into fighting vessels of
considerable force.</p>

<p>By 1830 steam navigation had made significant strides along
the lines of commercial development. In that year a service
of steam mail boats started to run at regular intervals between
Falmouth and Corfu, covering the distance in about one-fourth
of the time which had been taken by the sailing packets;
a Dutch government steamer, the <i>Curaçoa</i>, built in England,
had since ’27 been running between Holland and the East
Indies; and already the Indian Government had built an
armed steamer, designed as the forerunner of others which
were to connect Bombay with Suez and thus to place India
in more direct communication with England.</p>

<p>The navy was still represented only by paddle-tugs. With
a change of administration, however, came a change in
Admiralty policy. The new Board took a distinctly progressive
view. It was agreed that, if foreign powers initiated the
building of steam war-vessels, this country must build as well,
and not only as well but better: a policy tersely summed up
by Admiral Sir T. M. Hardy in his saying, “Happen what will,
England must take the lead.” Certain objections to steam
vessels as naval units which had hitherto held a vogue were
now seen to be ill-founded or baseless. In particular it was
discovered, not without surprise to many, that steamers
could be manœuvred without difficulty. A paddlewheel
steamer, the <i>Medea</i>, gained her commander considerable
credit from the skill with which she was navigated from the
Thames into the basin at Woolwich dockyard, which proved
that steamers could be steered and manœuvred better than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
sailing ships. In ’33 the construction of steamers was placed
in the hands of the Surveyor.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p>But small progress was made. One reason alleged was that
the shape of hull which the Surveyor had made peculiarly his
own was ill-adapted for steam machinery. “Nothing more
unpropitious,” observed a later writer, “for Sir William
Symond’s mode of construction than the introduction of steam
can be conceived. His sharp bottoms were the very worst
possible for the reception of engines; his broad beam and
short length the most unfavourable qualities that could be
devised for steam propulsion. As much as he could, he
adhered to his principles.... Rather than yield to the demands
of the new power, he sacrificed the armaments of his vessels,
kept down the size of their engines, and recklessly exposed the
machinery to shot should they go into action.”<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> There doubtless
was something in this criticism. And yet, as we have seen,
experience in America led to a form of hull for paddle steamers
in many respects approaching that condemned as being
favoured by the Surveyor!</p>

<p>Another and more valid reason for the slow progress made
lay in the inherent unsuitability of the paddlewheel steamer
as a substitute for the large sailing warship. Not only did the
paddlewheels offer a large and vulnerable surface to destruction
by enemy shot, but the wheels and their machinery could
not be embodied in a ship design without interference with
its sails and sailing qualities and, still more, without serious
sacrifice of broadside armament. The machinery monopolized
a large section of the midship space, the huge wheels covered
the sides and interfered with the training of those guns for
which room remained. The problem of arming steam-vessels
was novel and difficult of solution. The guns must be few and
therefore powerful. Hence it appeared that paddlewheel
steamers, notwithstanding the advantages they possessed of
speed and certainty of motion, could only sustain a small
concentrated armament, consisting of the heaviest and most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
powerful ordnance: guns of large calibre, which possessed
large power of offence at ranges where the broadside cannon
would be deprived of much of their efficiency. Hence in ’31 a
10-inch shell gun of 84 hundredweight was expressly designed
and cast for this purpose; and all the classes of steamers in
early use in the navy were armed with it until, in ’41, it was
displaced by the 68-pounder pivot gun, which then became
the principal pivot gun of the service. Thus the development
of paddlewheel machinery reacted on the development of
artillery. The steamer was a stimulus to the development of
large ordnance worked on the pivot system. And this form of
armament in turn influenced the form of the ship. The main
weights—those of the propelling machinery—were already
concentrated in the waist of the vessel, and it was now possible
so to place the few pivot guns that the ends of the vessel were
left very lightly loaded. Thus it was possible to give unprecedentedly
fine lines to the new steamers, a sharp and lengthened
bow and a well-tapered run: an improved form of body by
the use of which high speeds were obtained. In the case of
commercial steamships the advantages of fine lines had already
been recognized, and their designers had been free to give
them a form which would allow of a high speed being attained;
but in the case of war vessels designed to carry a broadside
armament the limitations imposed by the heavily weighted
ends had hitherto prevented other than bluff bows and sterns
being given them. But now the subject of ship form came
under general consideration, and the new conditions led to a
more serious study of the laws governing the motion of bodies
through water.</p>

<p>Year after year the size of steamers grew.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> And as with
size the cost of construction and maintenance increased, the
question pressed itself more and more clearly—what was the
naval utility of such expensive and lightly armed vessels?
Numerous attempts were made to produce a form of paddlewheel
steamer which would carry a broadside armament comparable
with that which a sailing vessel of the same burthen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
would bear. In 1843 the <i>Penelope</i>, 46 guns, was cut in halves
at Chatham and lengthened by the addition of about 65 feet,
in which space engines of 650 horse-power were installed. But
the extra displacement failed to compensate for the weight of
the machinery; the altered vessel drew more water than had
been anticipated and, though various alterations were made
to minimize the effects of this, the experiment was not a
success and was not repeated. In ’45 a steam frigate called
the <i>Odin</i> was built by order of the Board. “The results aimed
at in constructing this ship were—capability of carrying
broadside armament; diminished rolling, in comparison with
any war steamers then built; and less draught of water in
relation to the size. These objects were accomplished; but
as the position of the machinery and boilers is partially above
the water-line, and the propellers are exposed to danger in
broadside fighting, the ship is necessarily imperfect in these
two conditions, as well as in the position of the sails; for in
this case the proper place of the mainmast was occupied by
the boilers, and consequently the centre of effort of the wind
on the sails is in a wrong place.”<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> In the same year the <i>Sidon</i>
was laid down, the design being on the lines of the <i>Odin</i> but
modified in accordance with the ideas of Sir Charles Napier:
with greater depth of hold and with machinery below the
water-line. Iron tanks were placed in the hold for carrying
the coals; by filling these with water when empty the steamer
was kept at a more or less constant draught, a matter of considerable
importance to the efficient working of the paddlewheels.
In other respects, however, the <i>Sidon</i> was unsatisfactory.
She was so crank that the addition of ballast and a
modification of her armament were necessary. Her engines
were cramped, her boilers of insufficient power and of unsuitable
design, and her coal capacity too small to give her a useful
radius of action. For the attainment of all the properties
specified it was subsequently calculated and shown that a
much larger displacement was necessary. Just as Fitch had
discovered and Fulton had discerned, increase in scale reduced
many of the difficulties encountered in designing heavily
weighted steam vessels. Hence the success of the <i>Terrible</i>.
In the case of the <i>Terrible</i>, a large paddlewheel frigate of 1,850
tons and 800 horse-power built in 1845, it was clear that an
increase of size had given a partial solution to the problem of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
designing a war-vessel with heavy and spacious propelling
machinery, with adequate armament, and with full sail-power
and all the properties of a sailing ship.</p>

<p>Still the steam war-vessel was not satisfactory. Her
machinery usurped the weight and space required for armament,
her cumbrous paddlewheels were far too exposed to
damage by shot or shell. And how to surmount these difficulties
and reconcile the conflicting requirements of artillery
and motive power, was a problem which cost the country years
of unsuccessful experiments and millions of money. “It
was,” said Dahlgren, “the riddle of the day.”</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>The problem was solved by the adoption of the screw
propeller.</p>

<p>Since Archimedes’ day the screw had been known in the
form of a pump, and in two familiar objects—the smoke-jack
and the windmill—the principle of the driven screw had been
for centuries widely employed. In connection with ship
propulsion the screw appears to have been tried at an early
date, like the Marquis of Worcester’s water-wheel, in the form
of a mill. Among the machines and inventions approved by
the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris between the years
1727 and 1731 is one described as a screw, suspended in a
framework between two boats, which when acted upon by the
current was intended to warp the vessels upstream, the motion
of the screw being transmitted to a winch barrel on which a
tow-rope was wound. But so far as is known no attempt had
been made at this date to use the screw directly as a propeller.
In 1768 its use in this form was suggested in a work entitled
<cite>Théorie de la Vis d’Archimede</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> And shortly after, as we have
already seen, Bramah in England and Bushnell in America<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
had patented, and the latter had actually put into use, the
screw as a means of propelling vessels through water. We
have seen, too, that Fulton successfully adapted the screw
propeller, on a small scale, in one of his experimental steamboats.
Sporadic attempts were made in the early days of the
nineteenth century both in this country and in America to
drive ships by means of screws, both manually and by the
medium of steam, some of which were attended with a certain
measure of success.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> Yet some time was to elapse before
screw propulsion gained recognition. Doubt as to the efficiency
of a screw’s action, ignorance as to the shape of the vessel
required and as to the best position for the propeller, difficulty
in accommodating the early long-stroke steam engine to drive
direct an under-water propeller shaft; inertia, prejudice and
vested interest, all seem to have played a part in delaying the
adoption of what, when it did come, was acknowledged to be
the only suitable form of steam propulsion for war vessels.</p>

  <div class="caption">PETTIT SMITH’S PROPELLER</div></div>

<p>In 1825 a premium was offered by the Admiralty for the
best plan of propelling vessels without paddlewheels; and a
plan proposed by Commander S. Brown, R.N., was deemed
sufficiently promising for trial: a two-bladed screw propeller
placed at the bow of a vessel and actuated by a 12-horsepower
engine. But though exhibiting advantages this form
of the invention did not survive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
The history of the screw-propeller may be said to date from
1836. In that year two capable inventors obtained patents:
Mr. Francis Pettit Smith and Captain Ericsson. So little
attention had, up to that time, been given to the subject that
the two proposals “were presented to the public in the character
of novelties, and as such they were regarded by the few
who had curiosity enough to look at them.” Smith’s patents
were for the application of the screw to propel steam vessels
by fixing it in a recess or open space formed in the deadwood;
and, says Fincham, “the striking and peculiar merit of Mr.
Smith’s plan appears to consist, <em>chiefly</em>, in his having chosen
the right position for it to work in.” Trials were carried out
with Smith’s propeller in a 6-ton boat on the City and Paddington
canal, and then between Blackwall and Folkestone, with
encouraging success; the boat, encountering heavy weather
off the Foreland, demonstrated the advantage derived from
the absence of paddlewheels, and showed the new form of
propelling machinery to place no limitations on her qualities
as a sailing vessel. She returned to Blackwall, having run
over 400 miles at a mean speed of 8 knots.</p>

<p>Captain Ericsson, a Swedish army officer who had come to
London and established himself as a civil engineer, had a
contemporary success with a boat fitted with two large-bladed
propellers each 5 feet 3 inches in diameter. So successful was
he, indeed, that he invited the Board of Admiralty to take a
trip in tow of his novel craft; a trip which had important and
unexpected results on the subsequent progress of steam
navigation. One summer day in ’37 the Admiralty barge, in
which were the Surveyor and three other members of the
Board, was towed by Ericsson’s screw steamer from Somerset
House to Limehouse and back at a speed of 10 knots. The
demonstration was a complete success, and the inventor anticipated
some further patronage of his invention. But to his
chagrin nothing was asked of him, and to his amazement he
was subsequently informed that the proposal to propel warships
by means of a screw had been pronounced impracticable.
Never, perhaps, in the whole history of mechanical progress
has so signally wrong a decision been made, never has expert
opinion been so mistaken. Engineers and shipbuilders all
failed to realize the possibilities of the screw. The naval
authorities who, in the face of their personal experience, dismissed
the project as impracticable (owing to some anticipated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
difficulties in steering ships fitted with screws) merely expressed
the unanimous opinion of the time. “The engineering corps
of the empire were arrayed in opposition to it, alleging that it
was constructed on erroneous principles, and full of practical
defects, and regarding its failure as too certain to authorize
any speculations even of its success. The plan was specially
submitted to many distinguished engineers, and was publicly
discussed in the scientific journals; and there was no one but
the inventor who refused to acquiesce in the truth of the
numerous demonstrations, proving the vast loss of mechanical
power which must attend this proposed substitute for the old-fashioned
paddlewheel.”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> Yet in five years’ time steamers
designed for paddlewheels were being converted to carry
screws, and a great screw-propelled liner, the <i>Great Britain</i>, had
been launched for the Atlantic traffic!</p>

<p>It was in America, we have seen, that progress in steam
navigation was of the greatest interest to the public, and it
was by Americans that the disabilities of the paddlewheel were
most keenly appreciated. Two witnesses of the trial of
Ericsson’s boat saw and admitted the advantages of the new
method: Mr. Ogden, an engineer who had been U.S. consul at
Liverpool for some years, and Captain Stockton, U.S.N. The
latter appreciated the military advantages of screw propulsion
and was soon its enthusiastic advocate. Under his influence
and encouragement Ericsson threw up his engagements in
London and went to America. “We’ll make your name ring
on the Delaware,” said Captain Stockton to him at a dinner in
his honour given at Greenwich. The prediction was fulfilled.
In the course of time Ericsson saw his propeller applied on a
large scale, not only to mercantile craft but in the American
navy. Early in ’37 Captain Stockton had ordered an iron
vessel to be built by Messrs. Laird, of Birkenhead, and fitted
with a screw. In the following year she was launched, and in
the spring of ’40, after giving demonstration on the Thames
of the great towing power of her propeller, she left for America
for service as a tug on the big rivers. On this work one of the
great advantages of the screw was realized: the immunity
with which the screw vessel could work in drift ice, when
paddlewheel steamers were perforce laid up.</p>

<p>In the meantime, fortunately, Pettit Smith’s successes had
not been without their effect on opinion in this country. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
company was formed to exploit the screw, and a vessel, the
<i>Archimedes</i>, was built amid a strange chorus of detraction,
opposition and ridicule. She made her trials in October, ’39.
Her propeller was at first in the form of a complete convolution
of a helical screw of 8-foot pitch and of 5 foot 9 inches diameter;
but subsequently this blade was replaced by two, each of
which formed half a convolution, with the two halves set at
right angles to one another. Comparative trials were ordered
by the Admiralty in the following year to test the merits of the
<i>Archimedes’</i> screw as compared with the ordinary paddlewheels
applied to her Majesty’s mail packets on the Dover
station. The results were inconclusive.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> But a subsequent
voyage round the coasts of Great Britain, during which the
machinery of the <i>Archimedes</i> was laid open to the inspection of
the general public, and a later voyage from Plymouth to Oporto
which recreated a new record for a steam passage, went far to
establish in public estimation the merits of the new propeller.
But generally the invention was discouraged. Prejudice and
vested interests, rather than a reasoned conservation, seem to
have operated to oppose its progress. “A striking instance of
prevailing disinclination to the screw propeller was shown on
the issue of a new edition of the <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>, in
which the article on steam navigation contained no notice
whatever of the subject.”</p>

<p>But in spite of all prepossessions against it the screw had
won a decisive victory over its rival. So striking were the
results recorded by the <i>Archimedes</i>, that a decision was made
in December, 1840, to change the <i>Great Britain</i>, an Atlantic
liner then under construction, from paddlewheel to screw
propulsion. In two ways she was a gigantic experiment: she
was the first large ship to be built of iron, and it was now
proposed to fit her with a screw. Mr. Brunel took all the
responsibility for advising the adoption of both these revolutionary
features; the result was a splendid testimony to his
scientific judgment, boldness of enterprise, and “confident
reliance on deductions from facts ascertained on a small scale.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
Before the completion of the <i>Great Britain</i> the Admiralty
had initiated experiments which were to furnish important
information as to the power and efficiency of the screw
propeller in its various forms, and to settle beyond cavil the
question of its superiority over the paddlewheel for the propulsion
of warships. The sloop <i>Rattler</i>, 888 tons and 200 horsepower,
was fitted with screw machinery. Several forms of
screw were tried during the winter of 1843–4. First the
screw as used in the <i>Archimedes</i> was fitted: a screw of 9-foot
diameter, 11-foot pitch, and of 5½ feet length, consisting of
two half-convolutions of a blade upon its axis. Then a
screw was tried of the same diameter and pitch but of only
4-foot length; and then the length was again reduced to
3 feet. The effect of cutting down the length was to give an
increase of efficiency.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> The screw was again shortened by
2 feet, and finally to 1 foot 3 inches; with each reduction
in length the slip diminished and the propulsive efficiency
increased. Various other forms of screws were tried, and it
was shown that Pettit Smith’s short two-bladed propeller was
on the whole the most efficient.</p>

<p>The best form of screw having been determined, it still
remained to compare the screw propeller with the paddlewheel.
Accordingly the <i>Alecto</i>, a paddlewheel sloop of similar
lines to the <i>Rattler</i>, was selected as the protagonist of the older
form of propulsion, while the <i>Rattler</i> herself represented the
screw. Naval opinion was still completely divided on the great
question, while in the competing sloops the utmost emulation
existed, each captain advocating his own type of propeller.
The speed trials took place, and showed the <i>Rattler</i> to have an
undoubted advantage. The paddlewheel, however, laid claim
to a superiority in towing power. So a further competition
was ordered, as realistic as any, perhaps, in the history of
applied science: nothing less than a tug-of-war between
Paddle and Screw, those two contending forms of steam
propulsion! Lashed stern to stern and both steaming ahead
full power, one evening in the spring of ’45 the two steamers
struggled for mastery. And as <i>Rattler</i> slowly but surely pulled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
over <i>Alecto</i>, the question which had been for years so hotly
debated was settled; the superiority of the screw was demonstrated.
With the adoption of the screw the problem of
disposing the armament was settled. The broadsides and the
spaces between decks were once more free to the guns along
the entire length; moreover the action of the screw was in
complete harmony with that of the sails. With the screw as
an auxiliary to sail power, and subsequently with the screw as
sole means of propulsion, a change came over the character of
the pivot armament. Whereas with the paddlewheel the pivot
gun was the chief means of offence, when the screw was introduced
the broadside was restored, and though the heavy pivot
guns were retained (steam and the pivot gun had become
associated ideas), yet by their comparatively limited numbers
they became a subordinate element in the total armament.</p>

<p class="smaller">From an aquatint in the South Kensington Museum</p></div></div>

<p>External affairs now lent a spur to screw propulsion. In ’44
the French navy came under the reforming power of the
ambitious Prince de Joinville, and from this year onwards the
attitude of France to this country became increasingly hostile
and menacing. The thoughts of the French were turned
toward their navy. No sooner had de Joinville been placed in
command than schemes of invasion were bruited in this
country; and the public viewed with some alarm the altered
problems of defence imposed on our fleets by the presence in
the enemy’s ports of a steam-propelled navy. Sanguine French
patriots sought to profit by the advent of the new power. A
pamphlet appeared in Paris claiming to prove that the
establishment of steam navigation afforded France the very
means by which she could regain her former level of naval
strength. The writer, using the same arguments as Colonel
Paixhans had used in ’22, reviewed the effect of steam power
on the rival navies, and pointed to the Duke of Wellington’s
warnings in parliament of the defencelessness of the English
coasts and to his statement that if Napoleon had possessed
steam power he would have achieved invasion. These cries of
alarm, said the writer, should trace for France her line of policy.
She should emulate the wise development of steam propulsion
as practised by Great Britain. “We think, England acts; we
discuss theories, she pursues application. She creates with
activity a redoubtable steam force and reduces the number of
her sailing ships, whose impotence she recognizes.... Sailing
vessels have lost their main power; the employment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
steamers has reduced them to the subaltern position of the
siege artillery in a land army.” The writer praised English
policy in the matter of steam development: its wise caution,
its reasoned continuity. There had admittedly been some
costly deceptions. Nevertheless the method was to be commended,
and France should proceed in a similar manner: by a
succession of sample units while steam was still in the experimental
stage, by far-sighted single strides, and then by bold
and rapid construction of a steam navy which would compete
on more even terms with that of her hereditary rival.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></p>

<p>Faced with the probability that our rivals would pursue some
such progressive and challenging policy as outlined by the
pamphleteer, the Admiralty acted rapidly. Before the <i>Rattler</i>
trials were complete a decision was made favourable to the
screw propeller, and an order was made for its wide application
to warships built and building. It was resolved, on the advice
of Sir Charles Napier, that the screw should be regarded solely
as an auxiliary to, and in no way as in competition with, sail
power. The <i>Arrogant</i> was laid down, the first frigate built for
auxiliary steam power; and screws driven by engines of small
horse-power were subsequently fitted to other ships with
varying degrees of success.</p>

<p>Two important features were specified for all: the machinery
was required to be wholly below the water-line, and the screw
had to be unshippable. Engines were now required for Block
Ships and for sea-going vessels. So the principal engineers
of the country were called together and were asked to
produce engines in accordance with the bare requirements
given them. A variety of designs resulted. From the experience
obtained with this machinery two important conclusions
were quickly drawn: firstly, that gearing might be altogether
dispensed with; secondly, that no complex contrivance was
necessary for altering the pitch to enable engines to work
advantageously under varying conditions, the efficiency of the
screw varying very little whether part of the ship’s velocity
were due to sail power or whether it were wholly due to the
screw.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></p>

<p>And here it may not be amiss to note, in relation to a nation’s
fighting power, the significant position assumed by naval
material. In land warfare a rude measure of force could always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
be obtained by a mere counting of heads. At sea man was in
future to act, almost entirely, through the medium of the
machine.</p>

<p>However we may have deserved the eulogy of the French
writer in respect of developing the paddlewheel war steamer,
the development of screw propulsion in the next decade was
marked by a succession of failures and a large outlay of money
on useless conversions and on new construction of poor fighting
value, most of which could have been avoided. Had our
methods been less tentative and more truly scientific the gain
would have been undoubtedly very great; we should have laid
our plans on a firmer basis and arrived at our end, full screw
power, by a far less circuitous route than that actually taken.
In this respect France had the advantage of us.</p>

<p>Although a decision had been made to maintain the full sail
power of our ships and install screw machinery only as an
auxiliary motive power, attempts were naturally made to
augment so far as possible the power exerted by the screw;
and within a short time new ships were being fitted with
machinery of high power, in an endeavour to make the screw
a primary means of propulsion. The results were disappointing.
As the power increased difficulties thickened. The weight of
the machinery grew to be excessive, the economy of the comparatively
fast-running and short-stroke engines proved to be
low, and the propulsive efficiency of the screws themselves
grew unaccountably smaller and smaller. So poor were the
results obtained, indeed, that in the case of a certain ship
it was demonstrated that, by taking out the high-power
machinery and substituting smaller engines an actual gain in
speed was obtained, with the reduced displacement. The first
screw ship in which an attempt was made to obtain full power
with the screw was the <i>Dauntless</i>, of 1846. Although a frigate
of beautiful lines she was considered a comparative failure.
It was agreed that, equipped with paddlewheels and armed
with guns of larger calibre, she would have constituted a faster
and more powerful warship than, with her 580-horse-power
engines, her 10 knots of speed, and her 32-pounder guns, she
actually was.</p>

<p>Part of the trouble was due to the unsuitability of our ships’
lines for screw propulsion. It has already been noted that,
owing to the carriage of heavy weights at their extremities,
war vessels were always given very full bows and sterns. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
the case of the <i>Rattler</i>, whose records served as a criterion for
later designs of screw ships, the lines of the stern were unusually
fine: partly, no doubt, in imitation of the <i>Archimedes</i>. Also,
since it had been necessary to allow space enough for a long
screw to be carried (a screw of a complete convolution was
thought possible) the <i>Rattler’s</i> short screw as finally adopted
worked at some distance aft of the deadwood, and thus suffered
no retarding influence from it when under way. But in the case
of later ships these advantages did not obtain. They were built
with the usual “square tuck,” a bluff form of stern which
prevented a free flow of water into the space ahead of the
propeller and thus detracted from its efficiency. It was not
appreciated at this time that, for efficient action, the screw
propeller demands to be supplied with a body of unbroken, non-eddying
water for it to act upon, which with the square-cut
stern is not obtained. At low speeds, and in the ship to which
the screw was fitted as an auxiliary, the effect of the square
tuck was not marked. But as power and speed increased its
effect became more and more evident; the increase in power
gave no proportionate increase in speed; and many, ignorant
of the cause, surmised that there was a limit to the power which
could be transmitted by a screw and that this limit had already
been reached. The inefficiency of the square tuck was exposed
by trials carried out in H.M.S. <i>Dwarf</i> at Chatham. As a result
of these, future new and converted ships were given as fine a
stern as possible.</p>

<p>For several years, however, the policy of the Admiralty
remained the same: the screw was regarded solely as an
auxiliary. The French, on the other hand, took a less compromising
line of action. After waiting for some time and
watching our long series of experiments, they convened in
1849 a grand <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Enquête Parliamentaire</i>: a commission which,
primed with the latest information as to British naval material,
was to decide on what basis of size, number, armament and
means of propulsion future French warships should be built.
For two years the commission sat sifting evidence. And then
it recommended screw propulsion of the highest power for all
new ships, as well as the conversion of some existing classes to
auxiliary screw power. England had fitted her ships with
screws capable of giving them small speed; France must fit
hers with screws of greater power. Speed, said the commission,
is an element of power. Superior speed is the only means by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
which the English can be fought with a good chance of success.
Sails must be secondary, therefore, and full reliance must be
placed on the screw. The recommendations of the commission
were duly realized. In the following years a powerful force of
fast screw battleships, frigates, transports, and despatch boats
was constructed which by ’58 had brought the aggregate of the
horse-power of the French fleet almost to a level with that of
England.</p>

<p>When the Crimean War brought the two navies together as
allies in ’54 the full effect of the new policy of the French had
not yet been made apparent. Some apprehension existed in this
country as to the adequacy and efficiency of our navy, when
compared directly with that of France. But from then onwards
this country became aware of the increasing hostility of the
French public and government; speeches were made, and letters
appeared in the press of both countries, which tended to fan
the flames of fear and suspicion.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> It was not till ’58, however,
that general attention was drawn to the great strides which the
French navy had made in recent years, and to the skilful way
in which its position, relative to that of its great rival, had
been improved. An article entitled “The Navies of England
and France” appeared in the <cite>Conversations Lexicon</cite> of Leipsic,
and caused a great sensation. Reprinted in book form, with a
long analysis and with a mass of information about the French,
English and other navies and arsenals,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> this notorious article
brought apprehension to a head. Though written by no
friendly critic, it was in most respects an accurate presentment
of the respective navies and of their condition. The analysis
of Hans Busk, while ostensibly exposing its bias and its
inaccuracies, in effect confirmed the main contentions of the
German article; in addition his book gave in spectacular
columns a summary of the units of the rival navies, which gave
food for thought. The article itself professed to show how
much France had benefited by the bold and scientific manner
in which she had handled the problem of naval construction
since the coming of steam. Other factors were discussed, the
forms of ships, the Paixhans system of armament, problems of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
manning and of education; but the factor which had caused
the greatest accession of strength to France, by her wise
divergence from the English policy, was (according to the
critic) steam propulsion. In the case of paddlewheel steamers
England, by her unscientific and ruinous experiments, had
squandered millions of money and produced a series of crank
and inefficient war vessels. In the case of screw ships
England’s waste of exertions and money was even more
surprising; the building of new ships and the conversion of
others was carried out at an enormous cost with many galling
disappointments. The French, on the other hand, took longer
to consider the principle of the screw, but then, when their
more scientific constructors had completed their investigations
and analysed the new power, they acted thoroughly and
without delay. From all of which the German critic inferred
that England had good reason to watch with anxious eye the
significant development of strength on the part of her neighbours
across the Channel. “We must pronounce,” he concluded,
“that with a nearly equal amount of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i>, the
French navy surpasses the English in capacity and in command
of men. France need feel no hesitation in placing herself in
comparison with England.... Never was the policy of
England so yielding and considerate towards France as at the
present day. And then, with respect to the vexed question of
the invasion, it is certain that Napoleon III has the means of
effecting it with greater ease and far greater chance of success
than his uncle.”</p>

<p>The means was steam power. But the much-talked-of
invasion was never to be attempted. Other events intervened,
other developments took place, which reduced the tension
between the two great naval powers and removed for an
indefinite time the danger, which the Leipsic article disinterestedly
pointed out, of war under novel and unprecedentedly
terrible conditions: with shell guns and wooden unarmoured
steam warships.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE IRONCLAD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> year 1860 marks the most dramatic, swift, and
far-reaching change which has ever befallen war
material: the supersession of the wooden ship-of-the-line
by the modern battleship in its earliest form. What were
the causes, suddenly realized or acknowledged, which impelled
this revolutionary change, and what were the circumstances
which moulded the new form of naval construction? This
final chapter will attempt to show. Before descending to a
detailed examination of this evolution, however, let us trace
out the most striking features of the transition; their measure
of accuracy can be estimated by the light of the subsequent
narration of progress.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, we remark that, potentially, from the
time when shell-throwing ordnance was introduced into the
French, and then as a counter-measure into our own fleet,
unarmoured wooden ships were doomed. Strange it seems
that so long a time elapsed before this fact was realized;
though it is true that with spherical shells and small explosive
charges the destructive effects of shell fire were not greatly
superior to those of solid shot, that fuzes were unreliable, that
trials of artillery against material were rarely resorted to, and
that, moreover, no opportunity occurred between 1822 and the
outbreak of the Crimean War to demonstrate in actual sea-fighting
such superiority as actually existed. Implicit trust
was placed in our fine sailing ships. So long as solid shot were
used, indeed, these timber-built ships were admirably suited
for the line of battle; as size and strength increased and as our
methods of construction improved the ship gained an increasing
advantage over the gun, defence increasingly mastered attack,
to such a degree that by the end of the long wars with France
the ship-of-the-line had become almost unsinkable by gun-fire.
But so soon as shell guns were established—even with spherical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
shells fired from smooth-bore ordnance—wooden ships loomed
easy targets for destruction. For a long time this disquieting
conclusion was ignored or boldly denied; expert opinion with
sagacity turned a blind eye to the portentous evidence presented
to it of the power of shell. War came, but even then
the full possibilities of shell fire were not developed. Enough
proof was given, however, to show that in the special circumstances
of that war unarmoured ships were of small value
against shell fire. Armour was accordingly requisitioned,
and, some few years after the war, was applied to seagoing
warships.</p>

<p>Another development now took place. At this period when
disruptive and incendiary shell was proving itself a more
powerful agent than solid shot of equal size, both shell and shot
gained an enhanced value from the application of rifling to
ordnance; moreover, ordnance itself was developing so
quickly that each year saw an appreciable increase in the unit
of artillery force. This variation in the unit profoundly affected
naval architecture. No longer was there a unit of standard and
unchanging value, which, when multiplied by a certain
number, conveyed a measure of a ship’s offensive power. No
longer was the size of a ship a rough measure of its fighting
strength; by concentrating power in a few guns, offensive
strength could be correspondingly concentrated, if desired, in
a small vessel. On the other hand, in view of the sudden
accession of offensive strength, the defensive capacities of a
ship remaining as before, it was now true that size had become
an element of danger, diminutiveness of safety. Hence warships,
which had for centuries triumphed in the moral and
physical effect of their height and size, suddenly sought to
shrink, to render themselves inconspicuous, to take the first
step towards total invisibility.</p>

<p>An effect of the same development—of the increasing size of
the unit gun, and therefore of the decreasing number of units
which a ship could carry—was the mounting of every big gun
so as to command as large an arc of fire as possible.</p>

<p>As the final development we note that the steam engine, in
endowing the warship with motions far more variable, certain
and controlled than those of the sailing ship, called forth
tactical ideas quite different, in many respects, from those
which governed sea actions in the canvas period. The warship
itself is the embodiment of tactical ideas. Hence the design of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
the steam-propelled warship evolved along a different line
from that of the sailing ship.</p>

<p>By the effect and interaction of these developments a complete
revolution was compassed in naval architecture; by the
progress of artillery and the steam engine, and by the improvement
in mechanical processes in general, an entirely new unit
of naval force was evolved from the old sailing ship: the
mastless, turreted ironclad of the late ’sixties, the precursor
of the modern battleship.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>No sooner had the shell gun given proofs of its destructive
powers than experiments on the penetrative power of projectiles
began to assume importance, and as early as 1838 trials
were being made at Portsmouth against a hulk, the result of
which, confirming the experiments made by the French with
the <i>Pacificateur</i> some sixteen years previously, demonstrated
the far-reaching effects of explosive shell against a ship’s side-timbers.
Four years later the prime minister was apprised from
New York that the Americans had discovered a suitable and
adequate protection for ships’ sides; iron plates of three-eighths
of an inch in thickness, riveted together to form a compound
6-inch plate, were alleged to have been found ball-proof. On
receipt of which intelligence the Admiralty instructed Sir
Thomas Hastings, captain of the <i>Excellent</i>, to confirm or
disprove by actual trial. Trial was made, but it was reported
that no protection was afforded by such plates against the fire
of 8-inch shell or 32-pounder shot, even at 200 yards’ range.
No defensive remedy could be devised against shell fire, and
the only counter-measures deemed practical were of an
offensive nature, viz. to mount shell guns as powerful as those
of the enemy, and to keep him at a distance by the employment
of large and far-ranging solid-shot ordnance.</p>

<p>In the meantime iron, which was not acceptable as a protection,
had been accepted as a constructive material for
ships. For some years it had been increasingly used for
mercantile shipping with satisfactory results. The scarcity
of timber and its cost, as well as the positive advantages to be
obtained from the use of the much stronger and more plentiful
material, had decided the Admiralty in ’43 to build iron warships.
Some small vessels were built and, in spite of adverse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
criticism and alarming prediction, acquitted themselves
admirably on service. In ’46 it was resolved, however, to put
iron to the test of artillery. An iron steamboat, the <i>Ruby</i>,
was used as a target by the <i>Excellent</i> gunners, and the results
were unfavourable; the stopping power of the thin metal
was small, and the balls which went clean through the near
side wrought extensive damage on the opposite plates. In ’49
trials were made with stouter plates with more promising
results: a report favourable to iron as a protection for topsides
was made. But in ’51, as the result of elaborate trials
made against a “mock up” of the side of the <i>Simoon</i>, the
previous conclusions were reversed. Iron was condemned
altogether as unsuitable for ships of war. “The shot and
shell,” reported Captain Chads, “on striking are shivered
into innumerable pieces, passing on as a cloud of langrage
with great velocity,” and working great destruction among
the crew. Nor was a combination of wood and iron any better.
In fact the report claimed that, as regards the suitability or
the unsuitability of iron, these experiments might be deemed
to set the question at rest. The experience of the French had
apparently been somewhat similar to our own. In both
countries the use of iron for warships received a sudden check
and, in England at any rate, the idea of unarmoured wood
was once again accepted. In both countries the opinion was
widely held that iron was unsuitable either for construction or
protection, and that the view of General Paixhans, that
vessels might be made proof even against shells by being
“cuirassées en fer,” was preposterous and impracticable.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></p>

<p>Potentially, as it now seems, wooden sailing ships were so
weak in defensive qualities that the new artillery, if only it
could be adequately protected, had them at its mercy. Actually
it required the rude test of war to establish the unpalatable
truth. In November, 1853, such proof was given. At Sinope
a squadron of Turkish frigates armed with solid-shot guns was
almost blown out of the water by shell fire from a powerful
Russian squadron; the latter were practically uninjured,
while the Turkish fleet was set on fire and a terrible mortality
inflicted among the crews in a short time. General Paixhans,
who had lived to see his invention fulfil in actual warfare his
early predictions, was able to emphasize, in the columns of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
the official <cite>Moniteur</cite>, the arguments against large ships and
the advantages which would accrue to France especially
by the subdivision of force and the substitution of small
protected steamers armed with heavy guns for the existing
wooden ships-of-the-line. The concentrated fire of a few such
steamers would overpower the radiating fire of the largest
three-decker.</p>

<p>The type of naval warfare imposed on the allies in the
Crimean War lent special force to Paixhans’ arguments. For
the attack of fortresses and coasts whose waters were exceptionally
shallow it was at any rate clear that the orthodox
form of warship, unarmoured, of large size and of deep draught,
was of very limited value. Some special form was necessary;
France made a rapid decision. Napoleon III issued an order
for the construction of a flotilla of floating batteries, light-draught
vessels capable of carrying heavy shell guns and of
being covered with iron armour strong enough to resist not
only solid shot but the effects of explosive shell.</p>

<p>The idea of armouring ships was, of course, not novel.
Armour of sorts had been utilized from antiquity; in the days
when the shields of the men-at-arms were ranged along the
bulwarks of the war galleys; in the Tudor days when the
waists of ships were protected by high elm “blinders,” and
when Andrea Doria’s carrack was so sheathed with lead and
bolted with brass that “it was impossible to sink her though
all the artillery of a fleet were fired against her.” In the
eighteenth century the French themselves had attempted to
clothe floating batteries with armour, not indeed against
shells but against red-hot shot. In 1782 they had devised,
for the attack on Gibraltar, six wooden floating batteries
which, with their armament, were protected by a belt of
sand enclosed in cork and kept moist with sea water.
But this experience had been disastrous. The sand-drenching
apparatus failed to act, and the batteries were almost totally
destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>But now, although experiments with iron-plated ships had
been the reverse of satisfactory, data were to hand which
showed that, if used in sufficient thickness, iron plates <em>were</em>
capable of withstanding the disruptive effects of shell. At
Vincennes trials had been made, between 1851 and 1854, with
various thicknesses and dispositions of iron; with plates four
to five and a half inches thick, with compound plates, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
plates supported on a hard wood lining eighteen inches thick;
of all of which the thick simple plates had proved the most
effective. So the five floating batteries ordered for work in the
Crimea were covered with 4-inch iron plates backed by a
thick lining. Sixty-four feet long, 42 feet in beam, drawing
about 18 feet of water, armed with sixteen 56-pounder shell
guns and equipped with auxiliary steam machinery for
manœuvring, their construction was hastened with all possible
speed. By October, ’55, three of them, the <i>Dévastation</i>,
<i>Tonnante</i>, and <i>Lave</i>, had joined the allied flags, and on the
17th of that month they took a principal part in the bombardment
of Kinburn. Their success was complete. Although
repeatedly hit their iron plates were only dented by the
Russian shot and shell. “Everything,” reported the French
commander-in-chief, “may be expected from these formidable
engines of war.” Once again the arguments of Paixhans for
armoured war vessels had been justified; the experience
gained with iron armour at Kinburn confirmed that gained
with shell guns at Sinope. France at once proceeded to apply
these lessons to the improvement of her navy proper.</p>

<p>In England, on the other hand, no great impression was
created either by shells or by iron protection. A comfortable
faith in our fleets of timber-built ships persisted; and, with
regard to policy, as it had been with shell guns, and with steam
propulsion, so it appeared to be with armour; the national
desire was to avoid for as long a time as possible all change
which would have the effect of depreciating the value of our
well-tried material. At the same time it is remarkable how
small an effect was conveyed to expert opinion, both here and
in America, by the events of the Crimean War. In the years
immediately following the war some notable technical works
were published: Dahlgren’s <cite>Shell and Shell Guns</cite>, Read’s
<cite>Modifications to Ships of the Royal Navy</cite>, Grantham’s <cite>Iron
Shipbuilding</cite>, Sir Howard Douglas’ <cite>Naval Warfare with Steam</cite>,
and Hans Busk’s <cite>Navies of the World</cite>. From these works and
from the press and parliamentary discussions of the day it is
evident that, outside France, the impressions created were
vague and conflicting. The main lesson conveyed was the great
tactical value of steam propulsion. The reports laid no
emphasis on shells, and so scanty was the information concerning
them that it was very difficult to appraise their value.
Their effect at Sinope was disguised by the overwhelming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
superiority of the Russian force, which rendered the result of
the action a foregone conclusion; on another occasion (at
Sebastopol) shells fired at long range were reported to have
failed to penetrate or embed themselves in a ship’s timbers.
Commander Dahlgren was uncertain, in the absence of fuller
information, whether shells had justified their advocates or
not. Nor was Grantham impressed by the French floating
batteries. “One only of these vessels,” he incorrectly says,
“was thus engaged, but then not under circumstances that
gave any good proof of their efficiency, as the fire was distant
and not very heavy.”</p>

<p>So no violent change in our naval material followed as the
immediate result of the war. Only in the matter of light-draught
gunboats and batteries tardy action was forced on
the authorities by public opinion. Although iron had been
condemned for warship construction iron ships had been built
in the years preceding the war in considerable numbers for
foreign governments; the firms of Laird and Scott Russell
had built in 1850 powerful light-draught gunboats for Russia,
and in the same year Russia had ordered from a Thames firm
an iron gunboat whose novel design had been brought to the
notice of the Admiralty. But these craft were intended for
the defence of shallow waters, and nothing analogous to them
was considered necessary for the British navy. The exigencies
of the war demonstrated in the course of time the value of
these light-draught vessels. Still there was long hesitation;
though the French government pressed on us their advantages,
and presented our minister with the plans of their own floating
batteries. The disappointment of the Baltic expedition, however,
and the realization that the powerful British fleet which
in the summer of ’54 had set out to reduce Cronstadt had done
nothing but prove the inherent unsuitability of large ships-of-the-line
for the attack of fortresses in shallow waters, gave
rise to a loud demand in the press that gunboats should be
built. Several were accordingly laid down. The first of these
were found to be too deep, but others of lighter draught were
designed and by the autumn of ’55 sixteen were ready; and
these, together with some dockyard lighters which had been
fitted as mortar vessels, joined a flotilla of French floating
batteries in the Baltic and effectually bombarded Sveaborg.
As the war progressed the value of ironclad gunboats became
more fully appreciated. A large number was ordered, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
most of them were only completed in time to fire a grand
salute in honour of the proclamation of peace.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></p>

<p>Apart from the building of these gunboats innovation was
avoided. Unarmoured wooden ships, equipped with a mixed
armament of shot and shell guns, continued to be launched
and passed into commission, and it was only after France had
constructed, at Toulon in ’58, an iron-encased frigate, that
England unwillingly followed suit, convinced at last that a
reconstruction of her materials could no longer be averted.</p>

<p><i>La Gloire</i>, the iron-belted frigate, was the direct result of
the lessons gained from the floating batteries in the Russian
war. After Kinburn the French naval authorities took up the
study of how to apply armour to sea-going ships. Was it
possible to embody in a fighting unit sea-going capacity, high
speed, great offensive power, in addition to the defensive
qualities possessed by the slow, unwieldy batteries? Could
such a weight as iron armour would entail be embodied in a
ship design without loss of other important qualities? It was
concluded that, while it would be impossible to cover the sides
completely, it would be possible to protect the surfaces near
the water-line, under cover of which all the ships’ vital parts
could be secreted. A great increase in defensive power would
thus be obtained. Before developing a plan in detail it was
decided to carry out further armour trials, and solid iron
plates of 4½ inches thickness were fired at with English 68-pounders
and French 50-pounders, with solid balls and with
charged shells. The results were satisfactory, so these plates
were adopted as the standard of armour protection. To the
design of M. Dupuy de Lôme the first ironclad frigate was
constructed from a fine two-decked ship, the <i>Napoleon</i>, which
was cut down, lengthened, and armoured from stem to stern.
The result was the celebrated <i>Gloire</i>. She was followed shortly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
afterwards by two sister vessels. And then, in order to obtain
a direct comparison between timber-built and iron ships, an
armoured <em>iron</em> frigate, the <i>Couronne</i>, was also built. The three
wooden ships were given a complete belt round the water-line
of 4½ inches of iron; the <i>Couronne</i> had compound armour—3-inch
and 1½-inch iron plates separated from each other and
from the iron stem-plating by wood lining 6 inches in thickness.
The armament of all four frigates consisted of thirty-six
50-pounder shell guns, carried low. They were given yacht
masts and equipped with propelling machinery designed to
give them 12 knots speed.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>The naval position of England at this time was the reverse
of satisfactory. Comparing the material resources of the two
great maritime rivals, it came to be noted with surprise that
France, taking advantage of the development of steam propulsion
during the decade, had actually drawn level with
England in the numbers of steam warships available and in
their aggregate motive horse-power. The French had submitted
to great financial outlay on account of their navy. In
this country a reaction, following the large and partially
ineffective expenditure incurred in the Crimean War, had dried
up the sources of supplies and stunted constructional development;
there was little to show for the money spent on such
works as the enlargement of docks and on the extensive new
factories and docks established at Sheerness and Keyham.
Apprehension was widespread when the intelligence of the
building of the iron-sided ships was received, and this apprehension
developed when whispers reached Westminster of a
huge prospective programme meditated by France. To allay
the panic a parliamentary committee was formed to inquire
into the relative strength of the two navies; and their report,
published in January, 1859, made bad reading. Comparing
the steam navies—for, the committee reported, sailing ships
could not be opposed to steamships with any chance of
success—France and England each had afloat the same
number of line-of-battle ships, viz. twenty-nine; and as regards
frigates France had thirty-four to England’s twenty-six!
This did not include the four <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">frégates blindées</i> laid down by
France, which would be substitutes for line-of-battle ships,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
which were being built with the scantling of three-deckers,
and which were to be armed with thirty-six heavy guns, most
of them 50-pounders throwing an 80-pound hollow percussion
shell. “So convinced do naval men seem to be in France,”
note the committee, “of the irresistible qualities of these
ships, that they are of opinion that no more ships-of-the-line
will be laid down, and that in ten years that class of vessel will
have become obsolete.” The position is bad enough; yet
so bewildered are our experts by the radical developments of
the rival navy, so difficult appears the problem of countering
the French designs by any new and well-studied procedure, that
all that the committee can recommend is the accelerated conversion
of our remaining sailing ships to steam. The committee
realize that naval architecture, and still more naval
artillery, is in a state of transition, and that the late invention
of Armstrong’s gun “may possibly affect even the size and
structure of ships of war.”</p>

<p>It is not possible, however, for a country desirous of maintaining
its maritime supremacy to wait upon perfection in the
manner implied as the policy of the parliamentary committee.
Some drastic and immediate action was necessary, to redress
the advantage accruing to France from the possession of the
<i>Gloire</i> and her sister frigates. Such action was duly taken;
but before proceeding to examine this action it will be necessary
to revert for a moment to a consideration of iron. We have
already sketched the evolution of iron as a protective covering
for warships; we must now glance back and briefly trace its
progress as a constructive material.</p>

<p>Iron vessels had appeared on the canals of England in the
latter part of the eighteenth century. In 1815 a pleasure boat
of that material had sailed on the River Mersey, attracting
crowds of people whose credulity had been severely strained
by the statement that an iron ship would float. Admiral
Napier had manifested an early interest in iron ships; in
1820, in partnership with a Mr. Manby, he had constructed
the first iron steamer, the <i>Aaron Manby</i>, and navigated it
from London up the Seine to Paris, where in ’22 it attracted
considerable attention. From this date onwards iron vessels
increased in number. In ’39 the <i>Nemesis</i> and <i>Phlegethon</i> were
built by Mr. Laird for the East India Company, and in the
China war of ’42 these gunboats played a conspicuous and
significant part. The grounding of the <i>Nemesis</i> in ’40 on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
rocks of Scilly afforded early evidence of the value of watertight
bulkheads (a Chinese invention) when embodied in an
iron hull.</p>

<p>As the size of ships increased, the disabilities attaching to
the use of timber became more and more evident. Though
braced internally by an elaborate system of iron straps, knees,
and nutted bolts in iron or copper, the large timber-built ship,
considered as a structure, was fundamentally weak; in fact
the presence of the straps and ties contributed in no small
degree to its inability to withstand continuous stress. The
fastenings did not accord with the materials which they
fastened together, and the wood was relatively so soft that
when a severe strain arose a general yielding took place, the
boltheads sinking into the wood and causing it to give way
to the pressure thrown locally upon it. As tonnage increased
the metal fastenings grew more and more conspicuous, the
ship became a composite structure of wood and iron, with the
result that uniformity of elasticity and strength was lost and
the stresses, instead of being distributed throughout the
structure, tended to become localized at certain points. “The
metallic fastenings of a timber-built ship act to accelerate her
destruction so soon as the close connection of the several parts
is at all diminished.” So in 1840 wrote Augustin Creuze, a
graduate of the disbanded school of naval architecture and
one of the most gifted and eminent men of his profession at
that day.</p>

<p>Iron ships, on the other hand, were found to be well adapted
to withstand the racking stresses, the localized loads and the
vibrations which were introduced by steam machinery; they
were lighter than wooden ships, more capacious, more easily
shaped to give the fine lines necessary for speed, cheaper and
immeasurably stronger. In course of time the objections to
them gradually vanished; by aid of the scientists the derangement
of their compasses was overcome, the dangers from
lightning were obviated, and the extent of the fouling to which
their surfaces were liable was kept within limits. In course of
time, in spite of natural preference and vested interest, and
since the advantages of iron were confirmed by continuous
experience, wood became almost entirely superseded by the
metal for large mercantile construction. But in the case of
warships, as we have seen, insuperable objections seemed to
prohibit the change of material. No sooner had a step been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
taken by the Admiralty, in the ordering of a group of iron
paddlewheel frigates in ’43, than an outcry arose; the wooden
walls of England were in danger, the opponents of iron declared,
and iron ships were wholly unsuitable for warlike
purposes. More were ordered in ’46. Sir Charles Napier,
whose opinion naturally carried great weight with the public,
led the opposition, and when, in ’49, the artillery trial demonstrated
the dangerous effects of shot and shell on thin iron
plates, the advocates of iron were fain to admit the error of
their opinions. The iron frigates were struck from the establishment
and transformed—such of them as were completed—into
unarmed transports.</p>

<p>As experience with iron ships accumulated, the feeling grew
in certain quarters that the artillery trials, the results of which
had been claimed as being decisive proof of the unsuitability
of iron for warships, might not have been the last word upon
the subject. The events of the Crimean War tended to emphasize
the doubt and uncertainty. A few there were who saw in
that war clear proofs of the superiority of iron over wood;
who argued that, though iron had proved to be dangerous in
the form of thin plates in certain circumstances, yet it had
shown itself to be impervious both to shot and shell, and
indeed an indispensable defence in certain circumstances when
applied in sufficient thickness; that thicker plates than those
condemned as dangerous might therefore prove to be a great
protection against shell fire; and that, even as regards thin
plates, the splintering effect of shell against these was small,
from all accounts, compared with the <em>incendiary</em> effect of shell
against timber. And in what other respects were the advantages
of iron contested?</p>

<p>But, acting upon expert advice and influence, doubtless, by
the remembrance of the <i>Birkenhead</i> and <i>Simoon</i> fiasco, the
government still felt unable to sanction the use of iron, and it
was not until news of the laying down of the <i>Gloire</i> reached
England that a decision was made to adopt the new material,
both as armour and for the hulls of warships.</p>

<p>The high protagonist of timber-built ships, it was shortly
afterwards revealed, was Sir Howard Douglas: the most
strenuous advocate of iron was John Scott Russell. For years,
it appeared, Sir Howard had been the influential and successful
adviser of the government against the adoption of iron. “I was
consulted by Sir Robert Peel,” he wrote in 1860, “on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
accession to the government, as to the use and efficiency of a
certain half-dozen iron frigates, two of which were finished,
and four constructing by contract. I stated in reply that
vessels wholly constructed of iron were utterly unfit for all the
purposes of war, whether armed or as transports for the conveyance
of troops.” In the same paper he stated the arguments
on which he had tendered this advice; and these arguments
appeared so fallacious, and the facts on which they were
based so disputable, as to seem to call for some reply from the
builders of iron ships. Sir Howard had certainly strayed far
from science in his unsupported statements as to the calamitous
effects of iron if used for warships; and unfortunately he had
allowed himself to stigmatize the <i>Great Eastern</i>, as representative
of iron ships generally, as “an awful roller,” and as
never having attained anything like her calculated speed.
Scott Russell made a violent reply. “After establishing that
Sir H. Douglas’s conclusions are the reverse of the truth,” he
began, “I shall proceed to establish that the future navy of
England must be an iron navy. That its construction must be
founded on facts and principles, which Sir H. Douglas’s writings
ignore, and his deductions contradict; and I believe I shall
prove that if iron ships had been introduced at the time when
Sir Howard says he sedulously and systematically opposed
their introduction, the money which has been spent on a
wooden fleet about to become valueless would have given
England a fleet greatly more powerful than the combined
navies of the world.”<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></p>

<p>It may be conceded that in this public argument Scott
Russell had the advantage: the architect of the <i>Great Eastern</i>
had little difficulty in confuting the views of the artillerist.
But by this time the battle between wood and iron had been
fought and won. The Board of Admiralty, influenced by the
arguments of Scott Russell and their own constructors, and in
the presence of gigantic achievements in the form of iron-built
liners, felt unable to agree with Sir Howard in his continued
advocacy of timber; Sir John Pakington expressed his
personal doubts to him in a correspondence. Expert opinion,
naval officers and architects, leaned more and more in the
direction of the new material, and, early in 1859, the decision
was made to build an armoured frigate <em>of iron</em>. It was a
momentous decision. The “wooden walls” had crumbled at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
last, and iron had won acceptance as alone able to cope with
the new forces brought into existence by the progress of
artillery and steam machinery. The opponents of iron could
not sustain for long their arguments in favour of timber;
experience was accumulating against them, and it was necessary
to accept defeat. Chief among them was Sir Howard
Douglas. There is, surely, something pathetic in the episode
of his long-continued struggle against radical change; something
tragic in the spectacle of this scientist, whose labours
had done more, perhaps, than any other man’s for the efficiency
of the nineteenth-century navy, in his old age casting the great
weight of his influence unwittingly against the navy’s interest?
How gamely the old general fought for his convictions is told
us by his biographer, who with a natural warmth denounced the
fierce criticism which Scott Russell had directed against a
veteran of eighty-five winters, devoting his last hours to the
service of his country. “His resistance to armour ships bore
him down, his arguments met with unbelief, or elicited taunts,
and ceased to influence the public. ‘All that I have said
about armour ships will prove correct,’ he remarked, twenty-four
hours before his death, toward the end of ’61. ‘How
little do they know of the undeveloped power of artillery!’”</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>In June, 1859, some months before the launching of the
<i>Gloire</i>, the reply was given: the <i>Warrior</i> was laid down. Up
to this time the initiative, in the slow evolution of naval
material, had rested mainly with France. From this moment
England, having taken up the challenge, assumed the initiative
and its responsibilities; and from now onwards, in spite of
false moves, failures, and ineffective expenditures of money
and labour, she regained more and more surely the preponderance
in naval strength which she had possessed of old. At last
a scientific era of naval architecture had opened. Up to this
time the design and construction of warships had been treated
as a mere craft: a craft hampered, moreover, by absence of
method, reluctance to adopt new views, limitations as to size,
interference and ever-varying decisions as to such factors as
the extent of sail-power or the number of guns to be carried.
By the official acceptance of scientific methods this was largely
changed. By the raising of the old office of Surveyor to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
dignity of Controller of the Navy, by the institution of a new
school of naval architecture to take the place of that suppressed
in 1832 (whose most eminent graduates, fittingly enough, were
the chief witnesses against the debased state and management
of naval construction as it was prior to 1860), by utilizing the
services of men trained in mathematics, the effect on naval
architecture soon became apparent. Originality had scope,
forethought and cleverness had full play; men of considerable
technical knowledge were pressed into service, who proved
well able to cope with the new developments.</p>

<p>The outcome of this new orientation was the <i>Warrior</i>. It is
usual to think of her as similar to the <i>Gloire</i>; like her she was
designed to resist the 68-pounder unit of artillery, like her she
carried a belt of iron armour 4½ inches thick, and was equipped
with steam machinery to give her a high speed. Yet in important
respects she differed from her French rival.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE <i>WARRIOR</i></p>

<p class="smaller">From a photograph in the possession of Dr. Oscar Parkes, <span class="smcap smaller">O.B.E.</span></p></div></div>

<p>Firstly, her size in relation to her armament caused general
surprise. Admittedly the policy of restricting dimensions,
pursued with such rigour from the seventeenth to the beginning
of the nineteenth century, had operated to the detriment of our
naval construction; admittedly the long and fine-shaped
sailing vessels built during recent years were greatly superior
to those of the older models; yet no reason presented itself for
building a ship, of armament equal to that of the 5000-ton
French frigate, which would displace over 9000 tons. Were not
cost and tonnage directly related, and was there some real
necessity forcing us to build ships of so large a size? Was it
true that the basins at Portsmouth would require to be
enlarged to take such a ship, and that her draught would be
such that she could only be docked at certain tides? The
question was debated vigorously by the Board itself. Three
considerations, according to an authoritative statement made
to parliament, prompted the decision to depart widely from
the design adopted by the French: considerations one or
more of which have influenced all subsequent construction in
this country. Firstly, the world-wide duties of the British
navy demanded a type of ship capable of making long and
distant voyages either with steam or sail: in short, a fully
rigged ship, a good sailer, and at the same time one with
sufficient carrying capacity to enable her to keep the seas for a
long time. Secondly, to ensure good sailing qualities and to
avoid a defect which had been experienced in our own ships<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
fitted with heavy pivot guns, and which was predicted in the
case of the <i>Gloire</i>, the extremities must be as lightly loaded as
possible, and not weighed down with heavy armour. Thirdly—and
this was more or less special to the period—since artillery
was already in a state of rapid transition to higher power, any
protective armour approved must sooner or later be insufficient
and require to be augmented. These conditions, and the
advantages which increase of length were known to give in
reducing the propeller power necessary to obtain a certain
speed, governed the specifications to which the <i>Warrior</i> was
built. She was given a length of 380 feet, machinery for a speed
of nearly 14 knots, full canvas, telescopic funnels, and waterline
armour over her central parts: the ends being left
unarmoured, but subdivided by watertight compartments. Of
her forty-eight smooth-bore guns, twenty-six were behind
armour and twelve were outside of the protective belt; the
remaining ten were mounted on the upper deck, also without
protection.</p>

<p>In another respect the <i>Warrior</i> bore witness to the foresight
of the Board. Hidden behind, and altogether disguised by, the
shapely bow with its surmounting figure-head, was a stout iron
ram-stem, worked to the knee and side-plates of the bow: an
inconspicuous but significant feature. Ever since steamers had
been established in the navy the possibilities of ramming had
been discussed. The revolution in tactics resulting from the
introduction of steam as motive power had been examined by
authorities such as Bowles and Moorson, Douglas, Dahlgren
and Labrousse, and all of them saw in the new conditions an
opening for the use of the ram. In ’44 Captain Labrousse had
suggested strengthening the bows of wooden ships for this
purpose, and in England Admiral Sartorius had become the
advocate of a special type of warship built expressly to ram.
The circumstances of the naval warfare of the Crimea, in which
slow-moving steamers operated in restricted waters, had
displayed to naval men the advantages to be obtained from
actual collision—from the use of their ship itself as a projectile
against the enemy’s hull. In the case of the <i>Warrior</i> an
additional argument was now to hand for providing a ram.
The use of iron as armour had restored the equilibrium between
defence and attack which had been disturbed by the adoption
of shell fire; nay more, it had actually turned the scale against
artillery, the 68-pounder being unable to penetrate the armour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
of the ship in which it was carried. For this reason, that for the
moment armour had the ascendancy over the gun, a ram was
considered to be necessary as an additional means of offence;
and a ram was accordingly embodied in the <i>Warrior</i>, to the
strength of which her converging iron-plate structure aptly
contributed.</p>

<p>And now, leaving the <i>Warrior</i> for a moment, it will be convenient
to glance ahead and note the part played by the ram and
the value set upon it in connection with later types of warships.</p>

<p>In 1860 no doubt was felt but that ramming would play a
very important part in future warfare. The experiences of the
American Civil War of ’62 seemed to supply a perfect confirmation
of this opinion. “We fought the <i>Merrimac</i> for more than
three hours this forenoon,” wrote the engineer of the <i>Monitor</i>
to John Ericsson, “and sent her back to Norfolk in a sinking
condition. Ironclad against ironclad, we manœuvred about
the bay here (Hampton Roads), and went at each other with
mutual fierceness.... We were struck twenty-two times, the
pilot house twice, the turret nine times, the side armour eight
times, deck three times.... She tried to run us down and
sink us, as she did the <i>Cumberland</i> yesterday, but she got the
worst of it. Her bow passed over our deck, and our sharp
upper-edged side cut through the light iron shoe upon her
stem, and well into her oak. She will not try that again. She
gave us a tremendous thump but did not injure us in the least....
The turret is a splendid structure....”</p>

<p>On the preceding day the iron-covered <i>Merrimac</i> had sunk
the wooden sailing ship <i>Cumberland</i> by ram alone, without the
aid of artillery, the shots from her victim’s guns glancing off
her iron casing “like hailstones off a tin roof.” She had then
opened on the wooden <i>Congress</i> with shell fire, and in a short
time the crowded decks of that ship had been reduced to a
shambles. Then she had fought the inconclusive duel with the
armoured <i>Monitor</i>. What lessons were at length driven home
by these three single actions! What a novel warfare did they
not foretell! The helplessness of the wooden ship when
attacked by an ironclad was apparent, the terrific effects of
shell fire were once again conclusively proved. The value of
thick armour was once more shown, but, above all, the power
of the ram, the new <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">arme blanche</i> of sea warfare, seemed to be
indisputably demonstrated. On both sides of the Atlantic a
revision of values took place: the wooden navies of the world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
sank into insignificance, the <i>Warrior</i> and her type were seen
to be the main support and measure of each nation’s naval
power. “The man who goes into action in a wooden ship is a
fool,” Sir John Hay was quoted as saying, “and the man who
sends him there is a villain.” The ocean-sceptre of Britain
was broken, thought an American writer forgetful of the
limitations of monitors, by the blow which crushed the sides
of the <i>Cumberland</i> and <i>Congress</i>.</p>

<p>Four years later the battle of Lissa, in which the ironclad
squadrons of Austria and Italy were engaged with one another,
gave confirmation that the lessons of Hampton Roads were
also applicable to blue-water actions. “Full speed. Ironclads
rush against the enemy and sink him,” was the signal made by
the Austrian admiral, Tegetthof. The ram was his chief
weapon of offence, the gun being a useful auxiliary in gaining
him the victory; gunfire, by disabling the steering gear of the
<i>Ré d’Italia</i>, making her an easy prey for the ram of his flagship,
<i>Ferdinand Max</i>.</p>

<p>Of all the factors influencing the evolution of naval material,
the experiences and records of actual warfare are naturally
considered to carry the greatest weight in council: they are,
indeed, the only data whose acceptance is indisputable. The
claims and achievements put forward in time of peace, however
their excellence may have been attested by the most realistic
experiments, are all referred to actual war for trial, and are
accepted only in so far as they fit in with war experience. But
sea actions between ironclads have been few and far between.
It has been the more difficult, therefore, to draw from them
the true lessons conveyed; the fixed points have been insufficient
in number, so to speak, to allow of the true curve of
progress being traced. Not only has this insufficiency been
evident, but the restriction in the area of war experience has
had another harmful effect, in that undue weight has been
given to each individual experience. Difficult as it always is to
strip each experience of its special circumstances and deduce
from it the correct conclusion, errors have undoubtedly been
made; and these errors have had a prominence which would
not have been theirs if the number of experiences had been
greater. On the other hand, an altogether insufficient weight
has commonly been given to the experiences of peace-time.</p>

<p>These remarks find one application in the ram, and in the
value placed upon it in the ’sixties and ’seventies. During<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
this period artillery was undergoing a continuous and rapid
improvement, eventually turning the scales against defensive
armour; steam power was expanding and the manœuvring
capacities of ships were being extended, so as to make ramming
an operation more and more difficult to perform. Yet faith in
the ram grew rather than decreased, influenced almost entirely
by the evidence of the two sea-actions.</p>

<p>What was the actual experience of ramming gained in
peace-time? In ’68 Admiral Warden, commanding the
Channel Fleet, reported: “So long as a ship has good
way on her, and a good command of steam to increase
her speed at pleasure, that ship cannot be what is called
‘rammed’; she cannot even be struck to any purpose so
long as she has room, and is properly handled. The use of
ships as rams, it appears to me, will only be called into play after
an action has commenced, when ships, of necessity, are reduced
to a low rate of speed—probably their lowest.” As time progressed
the chances of ramming certainly grew less. Yet Lissa
and Hampton Roads continued to influence opinion to such a
degree, as to lead to a glorification of ram tactics; in the press,
and in the technical institutions which had now come into being,
the ram retained a lustre which it no longer deserved. So long
as artillery was feeble and gunnery of low efficiency, and so
long as speeds of ships were slow and manœuvring power
restricted, the ram was of great potential value. As these
conditions changed, the value of the ram declined. But for a
time it was actually in question which of the two forms of
power, the steam engine or the gun, would ultimately exert the
greater influence as a weapon in action. The subject of a
Prize Essay for 1872 was, “The Manœuvres and System of
Tactics which Fleets of Ships should adopt, to develop the
powers of the Ram, Heavy Artillery, Torpedoes, etc., in an
action in the open sea”; and it was the opinion of the prize-winner,
Commander G. H. Noel, that the ram was at that time
fast supplanting the gun in importance. “The serious part of a
future naval attack,” wrote Captain Colomb, in <cite>Lessons from
Lissa</cite>, “does not appear to be the guns, but the rams.” And
the French Admiral Touchard described the ram as “the
principal weapon in naval combats—the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ultima ratio</i> of
maritime warfare.” “There is a new warfare,” said Scott
Russell in 1870. “It is no longer, Lay her alongside, but,
Give her the stem, which will be the order of battle.” And he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
predicted fleets of high-speed vessels, equipped with powerful
rams and twin-screw engines, in which both guns and armour
were merely of secondary importance. And writers on tactics
discerned future squadrons in action charging each other after
the manner of heavy cavalry.</p>

<p>The evolution of artillery falsified these expectations. With
the growing advantage of artillery over the defence, and with
the coming of the torpedo, fighting ranges increased and the
use of the ram declined. With greater speeds and greater
ranges the possibility of ramming became (as might be deduced
mathematically) a diminishing ratio; before the end of the
century it was sufficiently clear, and was confirmed by actual
warfare, that the ram formed but a very secondary factor of a
warship’s offensive power. But for some years ramming, and
“bows-on” fighting in which ramming was intended to play
an important part, influenced to a great extent the designs of
warships.</p>

<p>So much for the ram, first fitted in the <i>Warrior</i>. In her
sister ship the ram was less pronounced and, before Hampton
Roads had drawn attention to its possibilities, it was even in
question to renounce it altogether. In the case of the <i>Warrior</i>
the heavy figure-head so overhung the ram that many were
dubious whether the latter would seriously damage an enemy;
and, moreover, the wisdom of driving a fully rigged ship against
another vessel, and risking the dismantling of her masts and
rigging, was widely doubted. In other respects, except for her
armour belt and for the material of which she was built, that
vessel was not radically different from her predecessors; the
first of iron-built ironclads was a handsome screw frigate not
unlike previous British ships of her type, from whom she was
lineally descended.</p>

<p>Although on the whole she was a conspicuous success, it was
soon apparent that the great length of the <i>Warrior</i> tended to
make her difficult to manœuvre: in fact, made her deficient in
that very quality—handiness—which was indispensable to her
effective use as a ram. And this unhandiness was accentuated
in the <i>Minotaur</i> class which was begun in 1861. These
ships were given a belt an inch thicker than that of the
<i>Warrior</i>, and, partial protection being considered objectionable,
especially as leaving exposed the steering gear and a portion
of the gun armament, the belt was made continuous over the
whole length of the ship. This length, owing to the extra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
weight of the armour, was 400 feet: 20 feet greater than that
of the <i>Warrior</i> and a hundred greater than that of the longest
timber-built ships. At first, five masts were fitted, in order to
obtain a large sail-area while at the same time keeping the size
of each sail within desirable limits; but these were afterwards
reduced to three. Sail power and steam machinery were seen
to be an imperfect combination in so large a vessel. The
<i>Minotaur</i> class proved to be costly, unhandy and vulnerable
ships, and signalled a return to smaller dimensions. It was
found possible to design ships equally fast and equally well
armed and protected, by the use of fuller lines and less length
and an increased engine power. “Increased manœuvring
power and reduction in prime cost,” wrote the designer of the
new type, “more than make amends for the moderate
addition to the steam power.”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p>Here we may briefly note the conversion of the timber-built
fleet. In ’57 Captain Moorsom had submitted a scheme of
cutting down ships to a short height above the water-line and
using the weight thus gained to provide an armour belt. Sir
Charles Napier had advocated a similar policy in parliament.
As soon as the necessity for armour was accepted this policy
was adopted; not only were the resources of the private ship-yards
bent to the building of a fleet of new iron warships, but
the best of the old navy was metamorphized in the royal
dockyards by the process of the <em>razee</em>: the cutting down of
two-deckers and their conversion into iron-belted frigates. By
these exertions France was soon outstripped in the struggle.
For a long time she clung to wooden ships, though in ’62
she adopted iron for upper works; and of such ships, of
wooden bottoms but of iron above the water-line, she built a
fleet “possessing only one possible merit—uniformity; which
the new English construction lacked.” The combination of
heavy steam machinery and wooden hulls was the cause of
continuous difficulties; the growth of artillery rendered the
ships obsolete almost before they were built.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>By the time the <i>Warrior</i> and her sister ships were afloat the
great struggle between armour and artillery was well in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
progress. It was a struggle which was to lead to unsuspected
developments in naval architecture.</p>

<p>For the moment, and in the presence of the new iron-built
ironclads, the gun was at its lowest point of effectiveness. But
rifling had conferred new powers on it, and the greatest efforts
were being put forth to improve its position. As it grew
rapidly in size and power, naval experts were faced with a
succession of problems of extraordinary difficulty. Two things
were in question: both the type and the disposition of gun
best suited for a warship’s armament.</p>

<p>With regard to type, the adoption of armour inevitably gave
a set-back to the value of the shell gun. Shells, which would
rend and set on fire a wooden ship, would not pierce armour or
inflame iron plates; of which facts Hampton Roads afforded a
demonstration. It seemed clear also from that incident, to
experts in this country and in France, that no extension of the
Paixhans principle was likely to compete with armour in the
future. The system of shell fire of General Paixhans, like the
shot system of the inventor of the carronade, had relied on low
muzzle velocities and curved trajectories, to effect its purpose.
His shells were for lodgment rather than penetration, and did
not gain their effect by their kinetic energy; and in view of
this their inventor had himself conceived the use of iron
armour as the very means whereby they might be countered.
Nevertheless the Americans had been strongly attracted by
the Paixhans principle, and with their Dahlgrens and Columbiads
had extended it in practice to embrace the use of guns
of the largest calibres. The action between the <i>Monitor</i> and
the <i>Merrimac</i> did nothing to shake their faith in this class of
ordnance. Subsequent experiments appeared to confirm the
national predilection; and one of their writers, in giving
credit to the navy chiefs for adhering to the principle of the
large smooth-bore gun, recorded that the small-bore-and-high-velocity
theory had received its quietus by the utter demolition
of a 6-inch plate by a ball from a 15-inch gun at Washington in
February, 1864.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> In France and England it was held, and held
rightly, that high velocities were necessary for the attack of
armour.</p>

<p>If shell guns were of small value, what was suitable? Were
the old spherical solid shot still capable of beating the defence?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
A serious effort was made in this country to bring them to do it.
The Armstrong rifled breech-loading guns recently adopted
had been proving defective and indifferent on service; a
return was wisely made to muzzle-loading; and it was in
question also to revert to spherical shot and shell. Spherical
shot of hardest steel were tried by the <i>Excellent</i>, in the hope
that they would penetrate 4½-inch plates. Experimental guns
were also made, in 1864, to discharge 100-pound balls with
charges of 25 pounds of powder; guns so heavy (6½ tons)
that it was doubted at the time whether they could be
efficiently worked on the broadside of a rolling ship. Should
not increased power be obtained by persevering with rifled
guns? The advantages possessed by the rifled gun in ranging
power, accuracy, capacity of shell, were admitted; nevertheless
the navy as a whole favoured the smooth-bore, with its
simplicity, rapidity of fire, strength, and greater initial velocity,
and thought that, at close ranges, the 100-pounder 6½-ton
smooth-bore gun was the best and most suitable weapon for
the service. But the rifled gun was advancing rapidly. “By
May, 1864, the 7-inch muzzle-loading rifled shunt gun of
6½ tons had been tried in the <i>Excellent</i>, and had a good deal
shaken the position of the smooth-bore. Captain Key reported
that it was more than equal to naval requirements.... It
was admirably adapted for the naval service.”<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> This fired a
projectile 115 pounds in weight. By June of the following
year the target of 9-inch plate representing the side of the
<i>Hercules</i> had beaten the latest Armstrong achievement, a
12½-ton 300-pounder. And on this pretext, and judging the
defensive power of the whole ship by the defensive power of the
thickest patch of its armour, a still more powerful gun was
demanded for the navy by the inventor and by the press: a
25-ton 600-pounder.</p>

<p>So rapidly the power of ordnance grew. It has been observed
that of this feverish evolution of armour and artillery the
circumstances were doubly remarkable. Firstly, no foreign
pressure existed which called for such overleaping and experimental
advances. The Americans still clung to their smooth-bore
system; the French, who like us had adopted breech-loading
guns, retained the system in their service and suffered
for some years from its continuous inefficiency. Secondly, the
navy was itself “unwillingly dragged into the cul-de-sac of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
experimental construction induced by the clamour of public
opinion.” The type, the size of the gun which was to be
embodied in our latest warships, was decided mainly by forces
outside the navy, and changed from year to year. Naval
architecture changed with it. The adoption of the succession
of increasingly powerful rifled guns set experts at their wit’s
ends devising warships suitable for carrying them; entailed
continuous alterations both in the armaments of new ships and
in the design of the new ships themselves; but also, as it
happened, had the effect of giving this country a mastery over
naval material which it has never since surrendered.</p>

<p>The type having been decided for each individual vessel,
there remained the question of the disposition of the armament.</p>

<p>Two main considerations guided the evolution of the ironclads
of this period in respect of the disposition of their guns:
one mainly tactical, the other mainly constructive. It appears
probable that, from the date of Trafalgar onward, the limitations
of merely broadside fire had been realized; that the
end-on attack, such as had obtained in the supreme actions
fought by Nelson and Rodney, had shown the weakness of the
broadside ship in ahead fire and had made obvious the anomaly
that, in all ships-of-the-line, the course of the ship, the
direction in which the attack was made, was the very direction
in which gunfire was least powerful, if not altogether non-existent.
With the coming of steam and the consequent
growth of the ram and ramming tactics, this anomaly was more
and more apparent; and from the <i>Warrior</i> onwards each new
type presented an enhanced effort to provide, particularly,
ahead fire. The growth of the gun materially assisted this
effort. Ahead fire increased, between the years 1860 and 1880,
from zero to a large proportion of the total fire. The broadside
ship was for a time abandoned.</p>

<p>The constructive consideration was the requirement of a
protected armament capable of the maximum effective fire in
all directions. In the first half of the century an increased
effectiveness had been obtained, with the old-fashioned truck
guns, by adaptation of the ports or by use of specially designed
carriages, to permit of as large an arc of training as possible.
Even so the arc through which guns could be fired was
small, and in the case of the 68-pounder of the <i>Warrior</i>
was only thirty degrees before and abaft the beam. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
demand for greater utility was emphasized when, with the
increase in size of the unit gun, the number of pieces carried
by each ship was diminished.</p>

<p>How, then, having regard to these two considerations,
should a warship’s guns be disposed? Various methods were
adopted. In the first instance, it was seen to be possible to
augment the ahead fire of a ship, and to give a wide sweep of
training to some of her guns, by indenting the sides; by so
shaping the ship’s side-plating as to allow guns mounted in
the forward part to fire in the direction of the ship’s longitudinal
axis. At first, slight use was made of this method:
with the fine lines given to iron ships it appeared practicable
in only a small degree. Moreover, it was objected to as
causing a “funnelling” effect to the path of fragments of
enemy shell or shot; it was found that shrapnel shell, fired
at indented embrasures at Shoebury, broke up, and the
number of balls which entered the portholes was ten times the
number which entered similar portholes on a straight side.
But, after the <i>Minotaur</i> class, less length and greater beam
were given to ships, and recessed ports and indented sides
therefore became more feasible.</p>

<p>As guns increased in weight and individual importance the
advantages of concentration became apparent. It was now
undoubtedly desirable to protect <em>all</em> the guns; yet, if they
had been strung out along the whole length of the ship, the
weight, both of the guns and their protective armour, would
prove to be an excessive burden to the ship. Hence the advantage
of the <em>central battery</em>. By concentrating the guns into a
central area, an armoured box amidships, the weight of armour
necessary to protect them could be kept within reasonable
limits, protection was afforded not only to the guns but to the
vital parts of the ship, while at the same time the extremities
were left lightly loaded. The complete water-line belt of
armour was retained, but, both in the French and in the
English navy, the system of complete protection as embodied
in the <i>Gloire</i> and <i>Warrior</i> was given up.</p>

<p>This device of the central battery was at first used solely for
broadside guns. But the desire for ahead fire from behind
armour soon caused the adaptation of the battery to allow it.
Ports were cut in the two transverse bulkheads, the ship’s
sides were indented, suitable gun-mountings were provided
whereby some of the battery guns could be shifted from one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
porthole to another; and in this way it was secured that a
fair proportion of the armament could be fired either on the
beam or parallel with the keel-line of the ship. A power of
offence was given in all directions, and no “point of impunity”
existed.</p>

<p>Ingenious were the arrangements resorted to, to obtain the
maximum effect from the new medium-sized artillery which
superseded the original truck-guns of the <i>Warrior</i> and former
warships. The armoured boxes, instead of being made with
their sides respectively parallel, and at right angles, to the
sides of the ship, were sometimes set diagonally, with their
sides at forty-five degrees with fore-and-aft. Sometimes they
were octagonal, sometimes with curved bulkheads, sometimes
two batteries were superposed one on the other; but always
the desire was to utilize each gun over as large as possible an
arc of fire, and always the tendency was to augment the ahead
fire. The central battery formed a powerful citadel covering
the whole beam of the ship amidships. The guns of this
citadel, by the power of manœuvring given by the adoption
of twin-screw propelling machinery, could, it was argued, be
brought to bear in any direction desired. Of all directions,
“right ahead” was considered to be of the greatest importance.
End-on fighting, it was assumed, would always be resorted to
in future; and it was the power of keeping the ship end-on
to the enemy which was the great military advantage conferred
by twin screws.</p>

<p>A further step in the direction of giving to each gun a large
arc of fire was taken in the introduction of the sponson. By
means of this circular platform, projecting from the vessel’s
side, a gun could be carried so as to fire through an arc of 180
degrees. The same system obtained largely in the French
ships of this period; by mounting guns in overhung circular
turntables, one at each corner of the central battery <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en
caponière</i>, a large effective arc was obtained for them.</p>

<p>Only one step more was necessary: that which would allow
each gun to command the whole sweep of the horizon, and to
be available for duty upon either beam and any bearing: the
adoption of the <em>centre-line turret</em>. But before tracing the
evolution of the turret, let us recapitulate the typical ships
built between 1860 and 1873 which composed our central-battery
fleet.</p>

<p>The germ of the central-battery idea may be seen, perhaps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
in the belted <i>Minotaur</i>, in which, in order to allow the chase
guns to be fought from behind armour, a transverse armour
bulkhead was worked, at a distance of some 25 feet aft of the
bow. Had foreign influence not exerted itself it may be
supposed with reason that from the <i>Minotaur</i> the central
battery would have been evolved. However this may be, the
evolution was hastened by French initiative; for in each of
the two wooden ships <i>Magenta</i> and <i>Solferino</i>, laid down in ’59,
was found a complete two-decked central battery whose whole
depth was faced with armour for the protection of fifty-two
5-ton cannon, the rest of the ship’s water-line being protected
by an armour belt much narrower than that of the <i>Gloire</i>.
In imitation of this plan our own designs were prepared; and
gradually, and only by a series of steps, we achieved what our
rivals had obtained in a single stride.</p>

<p>In ’63 Sir Edward Reed, at that time Mr. Reed, one of the
graduates of the school which in ’48 had been established at
Portsmouth Dockyard, was appointed to the office of Chief
Constructor of the Navy. Possessed of broad and original
views and gifted to an unusual degree in the arts of exposition
and argument, he made himself responsible for designs of
warships differing widely from their large and unwieldy
precursors. The first of these was the <i>Bellerophon</i>, a short and
easily manœuvred, fully rigged belt-and-battery ship, carrying
ten 12-ton Armstrong guns for broadside fire in the battery,
and two 6-ton guns for ahead fire in a small armoured battery
in the bows. Not only in the disposition of her armament was
the <i>Bellerophon</i> different from all former ships. She was a
radical departure from existing practice in many important
respects. Constructionally, she was built on a new “bracket-frame”
system designed to give great girder strength for
small expenditure of weight, already in vogue for mercantile
shipping. The use of watertight compartments was extended
as a defence against an enemy ram, the system of double
bottoms was extended as a consequence of the introduction of
the torpedo. A powerful ram was carried, but the bow took a
new form; a U- instead of a V-section was adopted in order
to give buoyancy and thus minimize the tendency to plunge
which was inherent in a fine-bowed ship; the section near the
water-line being fined away so as to form a cut-water. Steel
was largely used instead of iron, with a consequent saving of
weight. A novel trim was given her—six feet by the stern—to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
give a deep immersion for the powerful screw and to assist
the ship in turning quickly on her heel under the action of the
balanced rudder; an adjustment which experience showed to
have a detrimental effect on the propulsive efficiency.</p>

<p>Next came the <i>Enterprise</i>, a still smaller ship. In the
<i>Bellerophon</i>, as we have seen, there was no bow fire possible
from the central battery; in the <i>Enterprise</i> this was obtained
by piercing the athwartship bulkheads of the battery with
ports, and substituting movable for fixed bulwarks. The
same arrangement was developed in the <i>Pallas</i> and <i>Penelope</i>,
in which ships the arc of fire of the corner guns of the battery
was further extended by the device of indented sides. Then
came the <i>Hercules</i>, generally like the <i>Bellerophon</i> but with
indented sides and, as a novelty, alternative ports in the
battery armour by means of which the corner guns could be
trained, on revolving platforms, to fire either on the beam or
nearly in line with the keel; a system which presented an
obvious disadvantage in requiring twelve ports for eight guns.
In the <i>Kaiser</i> class, designed by Sir Edward Reed shortly
afterwards for the German government, this disadvantage was
obviated by the expedient of forming ports in facets of the
battery set at forty-five degrees with the keel-line, and by
muzzle-pivoting guns.</p>

<p>Both in the <i>Bellerophon</i> and the <i>Hercules</i> axial fire had only
been obtained by the provision of special batteries, at the bow
and stern, of partially protected guns. Now, this accumulation
of weight at the extremities was a feature viewed with disfavour
by naval opinion; moreover, these bow batteries did
not meet the ever-growing demand for a considerable ahead
fire. So in the <i>Sultan</i>, which carried a central-battery armament
similar to that of the <i>Hercules</i>, an upper deck armoured
battery was embodied, superposed on the after end of the
main deck battery and carrying guns which gave both astern
and beam fire; while, for bow fire, two 12-ton guns were
mounted in the forecastle, but without any protection.</p>

<p>The central-battery system had now to sustain the greatest
attack that had yet been made upon it by the advocates of
centre-line turrets. The position of the central-battery school
was already somewhat shaken; ordnance had grown to a
weight and power which justified the main argument of the
turret advocates; Lissa had just shown the importance of
being able to concentrate on any one bearing a maximum of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
offensive power. Controversy raged hotly on the relative
merits of turret and central battery.</p>

<p>In these circumstances the Admiralty in ’68 determined to
consider both types, with a view to embodying the best arrangement
in the new class of vessels then projected. The principal
shipbuilders of the country were invited to compete, and were
presented with specifications for a first-class warship so widely
drawn as to leave them the greatest latitude in design. Of the
seven designs submitted, three were of the central-battery
type, three were turret ships, and one a compound of the two.
After comparison with an Admiralty design produced by Sir
Edward Reed, it was decided to adopt this in preference to
those of the private firms, and to build a whole class of six
ships to it. The result was the <i>Audacious</i> class—of which the
best-remembered are the <i>Iron Duke</i> and the ill-fated <i>Vanguard</i>.
In this class a strong all-round fire was obtained by arranging
two central batteries of the same size, one on the main and
one on the upper deck. The main deck battery had only
broadside ports for its six 12-ton guns, each gun training
thirty degrees before and abaft the beam; the upper deck
battery had four guns of the same calibre mounted at ports
cut in armour facets at forty-five degrees with the keel-line,
and training through ninety degrees. To allow axial fire from
these guns the upper battery was made to project slightly,
sponson fashion, over the sides of the ship, and the bulwarks
forward and aft of the battery were set slightly back toward
the centre line to enable the guns to fire past them.</p>

<p>A final stage in the evolution of the central-battery ship
was attained in the <i>Alexandra</i>, laid down in ’72. The type
had proved tenacious of life, and, for masted vessels, still held
its own up to this point against the turret system. The design
for the <i>Alexandra</i> gave as complete an all-round fire as was
attainable in a central-battery ironclad; for the first time, it
was said, we really had a masted ship with satisfactory all-round
fire. Generally like the <i>Audacious</i> class, the <i>Alexandra</i>
possessed an advantage in that the two forward guns of the
upper deck battery were 25 ton instead of 18 ton, and in
having, in addition to the six broadside guns of the main deck
battery, two additional 18-ton guns mounted so as to be
capable of firing nearly ahead and on the beam as well. Designed
to fulfil the requirements of “end-on” fighting, she
made a heavy sacrifice of broadside fire to obtain a maximum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
of bow fire; and at a later date, when a different valuation
had come to be placed on axial fire, this sacrifice was noted
against her. “She could only take her place at a disadvantage
in any form of battle which was suited to the armaments of
the ironclads that had gone before her.”<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> Nevertheless she
was a formidable vessel. Defensively, too, she was pronounced
to be conspicuously successful; her armour belt, which attained
a thickness of 12 inches at the water-line amidships, was
carried down at the bow to cover and strengthen the stem,
and to protect the vessel from a raking fire. For the protection
of the stern against a raking fire, an armour bulkhead was
worked across the after part, extending to a depth of 6 feet
below the water-line.</p>

<p>The <i>Alexandra</i> was the last of the purely “central battery”
ships.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> By the time she was launched experience had set the
seal of approval on another type, to the evolution of which
we must now revert.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>It is difficult to trace to its source the invention of the
armoured gun-turret. The inventive Ericsson is said to have
envisaged at an early age the idea of a protected gun carried on
a mobile raft, “an idea probably inspired by his river-rafts in
Sweden”; and it is known that at a later date he planned in
detail a primitive monitor, the design of which at the outbreak
of the Crimean War he offered to Napoleon III. Perhaps the
idea, which M. Paixhans first developed in public, of applying
iron armour to a sea-going ship, induced the idea of a pivot-gun
protected by an armour shield. A protected armament was
found, as we have seen, in the French batteries built for the
assault of Kinburn: the armoured vessel and the armoured
gun were first embodied in the same unit; and though these
units were the first to be tried in actual war, yet some years
previously, in 1842 or thereabouts, a Mr. Stevens of New York
had proposed and made an armoured floating battery. But in
neither of these instances was the gun in a turret. The turret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
idea, like so many other inventions, had an independent
development in Europe and in America. In each case war
supplied the incentive. In America, in ’62, Ericsson himself
produced in a national emergency the <i>Monitor</i>, the low,
shallow-draft armoured vessel carrying two 11-inch Dahlgren
guns in a steam-rotated turret which served to counter the
Southern <i>Merrimac</i>, the rasée with the fixed penthouse armour
roof over its guns which the Confederates had built by the light
of French experience.</p>

<p>The <i>Monitor</i>, both in design and in the circumstances of its
production, was a great achievement; its success gave sanction
to the revolving turret as a form of structure by means of
which a big gun could be carried and trained. Nevertheless it
is doubtful whether it influenced to an appreciable degree the
evolution of the sea-going turret ship on this side of the
Atlantic. Already, when the <i>Monitor</i> fought her action with
the <i>Merrimac</i>, the turret had been adopted in coast-defence
ships ordered for European powers; and, dramatic though
it was, the incident of Hampton Roads afforded merely a
confirmation of the effectiveness of the turret form of gun
mounting. It was to an episode of the Crimean War that
the development of the sea-going turret ship was directly due.</p>

<p>In the Sea of Azov, in the spring of 1855, Commander
Cowper Coles, of H.M. steamer <i>Stromboli</i>, constructed in a
single night, of barrels, spars and boards, a raft capable of
bearing heavy artillery, which he named the <i>Lady Nancy</i>; by
means of which he brought within range and destroyed by
shell fire the Russian stores at Taganrog.</p>

<p>The naval operations of this war had drawn general attention
to the special problems in connection with the navigation of
shallow waters by vessels with a heavy armament, and Commander
Coles’ exploit immediately excited official interest.
Models of armed rafts were submitted by him for Admiralty
inspection, and shortly afterwards he was himself ordered home
to give advice upon the requirements of this form of construction:
in connection with which the necessity for armour
protection for the gun or guns was a point early insisted on by
him. In that same year he sketched a design for a belted
shallow-draught vessel for the attack of stationary forts
which he equipped with guns of the heaviest pattern, each
working in a fixed hemispherical shield. From the fixed shield
to a revolving turret was a small step. In a short time Commander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
Coles made himself the enthusiastic exponent of
armour-protected guns, mounted in cupolas or turrets on or
near the centre-line of a ship so as to give a command over
nearly the whole sweep of the horizon. By such a system, he
argued, a vessel could be endowed with a concentrated offensive
power on any bearing unapproachable by broadside armament,
however designed; all guns were effective on almost any
bearing without diverting the ship, their force required no
evolution to elicit, existing as it did when the ship was at
anchor, in dry dock or on a constant course. The height of the
turrets gave them a plunging fire, an effect particularly useful
now that ships’ sides were armoured and their decks alone
remained penetrable.</p>

<p>His advocacy of the turret system, aided by the technical
assistance of Mr. Brunel, made a deep impression on a large
section of the public and gained the interest of the Prince
Consort. He did not profess the technical knowledge of a
shipbuilder or designer; but in his insistence on the advantages
to be derived from the method of mounting guns on the centre-line
he wielded arguments of great natural force, and enlisted
in his favour the professional sympathies of eminent builders
and naval men. In 1860 he produced before the newly
founded Institution of Naval Architects a plan of a sea-going
ship carrying nine turrets, seven on the centre-line and
two off-set so as to allow ahead fire from three turrets.
In the following year he wrote to the Admiralty undertaking to
prove that a vessel could be built on his principle of armament
100 feet shorter than the <i>Warrior</i> and in all military respects
her superior: “I will guarantee to disable and capture her in
an hour; she shall draw four foot less water, require only half
the crew, and cost the country for building at least £100,000
less. I am ready to stand or fall on these assertions.”</p>

<p>Such a pronouncement could not be lightly passed over.
Moreover, coast-defence vessels embodying the turret system—light-draught
vessels characterized by small tonnage, small
cost and indifferent sea-going qualities, in combination with
massive protection and a large offensive armament—were
already being built by the private firms of this country for
various foreign powers. In ’61, for instance, Denmark had
ordered the <i>Rolf Krake</i>, a turret gunboat carrying a 4½-inch
belt and four 68-pounder guns, a pair in each of two armoured
turrets; which three years later proved her value in action<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
against a nominally superior force. Prussia had ordered her
first ironclad, a turret ship. Holland, Italy, Brazil, Russia—all
were known to be purchasing coast-defence vessels of the
turret type. And two sea-going turret ships which had been
ordered by the American Confederates, and which were
building in this country—the <i>Wyvern</i> and <i>Scorpion</i>—had been
seized and purchased by our government.</p>

<p>In these circumstances the Admiralty, though there was a
preponderance of official opinion against the idea, resolved to
countenance the turret system and give it a trial. The
<i>Royal Sovereign</i> was cut down from a three-decker of 120 guns,
armoured with a 5½-inch belt and a 1-inch deck, and equipped
with four turrets carrying a total of five 12½-ton guns—two in
the foremost and one in the remaining turrets. At the same
time the <i>Prince Albert</i>, also a four-turret ship, was laid down by
the firm of Samuda to an Admiralty order. These ships were a
distinct success so far as the armament was concerned. They
were certainly not ocean-going ships. There were many faults
and undesirable features to be found in them. But the
disposition of the armament was found satisfactory, and the
captain of the <i>Royal Sovereign</i> reported most favourably of his
ship, describing her as the most formidable man-of-war; “her
handiness, speed, weight of broadside, and the small target
she offers, increase tenfold her powers of assault and
retreat.”</p>

<p>Time, and the progress of artillery, were on the side of
Captain Cowper Coles. He saw, and the Admiralty advisers
felt, that although it was possible to work existing guns on the
broadside, yet increase in the size and weight of guns would
sooner or later necessitate the mounting of them on accurately
balanced turntables secured by central pivots on the centre-line.
Only by such a method could the largest gun be worked
and the full weight of metal be poured, as required, on either
broadside. In fact the turret, the original object of which was
purely defensive, was now regarded from a quite different point
of view: as a convenient device by which guns of the highest
calibre could be carried and worked. Was complicated
machinery objected to? The common winch, the rack and
pinion, were in constant use on every railway turntable, nor
had the American turrets ever failed in action or caused a loss
of confidence in their reliability. Reliance upon a central pivot
was disliked? Yet the pivot was already in use for holding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
the broadside guns of our ironclads—a mere bolt 4 inches in
diameter and itself exposed to gunfire.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></p>

<p>The Admiralty constructors were insistent on the practical
difficulties which lay in the way of designing a satisfactory sea-going
turret ship. The advantages which had been claimed for
turrets were obvious, said Sir Edward Reed; the larger and
heavier the individual gun, the greater the gain of mounting it
in a turret. But enthusiastic advocates of this method lost
sight of the fact that turrets were incompatible with masts and
sails, and with the forecastle and high freeboard necessary for
good sea-going qualities. At that time, 1865, it was possible to
protect and work eight of the largest guns, mounted on the
broadside, with as little expenditure of weight as would be
required to mount four of the guns two in a turret on the
centre-line; while in the latter case they could only fire in two
different directions at the same time, whereas in the former
they could fire in eight.</p>

<p>In order to allow both sides in the controversy to come to
grips with the practical difficulties, a committee was formed
at the Admiralty in May, ’65, and Captain Coles was asked to
produce a turret-ship design by the aid of a draughtsman and
with the drawings of the <i>Pallas</i> for guidance. His design, a
vessel showing two 600-pounders each mounted in a centre-line
cupola, was not considered suitable. So the Board resolved to
build a ship to Sir Edward Reed’s design—a fully rigged and
masted, high-freeboard ship, with an armour belt and protected
bow and stern batteries, and with two centre-line turrets amidships
mounted over a central battery, each carrying two
25-ton 600-pounder guns. This was the <i>Monarch</i>. She was
the first truly ocean-going turret ship, and her performances
at sea in ’69 in company with central-battery ships like the
<i>Bellerophon</i> and <i>Hercules</i> proved her to be a valuable and
efficient unit; by this experiment it was demonstrated, said
Mr. Brassey, “that it was practicable to design a thoroughly
seaworthy turret ship, although for sea-going purposes a
central battery presents great advantages over the turret
system.”</p>

<p>In the meantime Captain Coles had protested vigorously
against the design of the <i>Monarch</i> as representative of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
system. The plan was not his; the turrets were mounted so
high that there was a large area to protect and the ship, unlike
the low-freeboard ships of his own design, presented a large
target. But his chief objection was, that the presence of a
forecastle and an armoured bow battery annihilated the whole
advantage of turret guns by preventing ahead fire from them.
After protracted negotiations he obtained Admiralty permission
to have a ship built to satisfy his own views and
independently of criticism from Admiralty officials. In ’69 the
<i>Captain</i>, built by Messrs. Laird to his drawings, was launched
at Birkenhead. The <i>Captain</i>, although generally similar
to the <i>Monarch</i> (the growth of artillery limited the number
of the turrets to two), differed from her in one important
respect: her designed freeboard was only 8 feet as compared
with 14; and, by some error in calculation, this dimension
proved to be only 6 feet when the vessel was in sea-going trim.
This low freeboard, in conjunction with her large sail-area,
produced a condition of instability at large angles of heel
which led to disaster and sealed the doom of the fully rigged
turret ship.</p>

<p>Even in the <i>Captain</i> ahead fire was not found possible.
In the original plans she had the low freeboard favoured by her
designer; but in the later plans poops and forecastles were
added to give the necessary sea-going qualities, and ahead
fire was thereby sacrificed. Complete mastage was given her:
iron masts in the form of tripods to avoid the use of shrouds
and to give as clear an arc of fire as possible. The rigging
was all stopped short at, and worked from, a narrow flying
deck which was built above the turrets. This flying deck
provided a working space for the crew, who in a moderately
rough sea would not be able to make use of the low upper
deck.</p>

<p>On the night of September 6th, 1870, the <i>Captain</i> capsized
in a heavy sea off C. Finisterre. In St. Paul’s Cathedral the
memorial brass, erected in commemoration of this disaster,
records that the <i>Captain</i> was built in deference to public
opinion expressed in parliament and through other channels,
and in opposition to the views and opinions of the Controller
and his department; and that the evidence all tended to show
that they generally disapproved of her construction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>The difficulty of combining the turret system with a full rig
of masts and sails had for a long time been recognized. Some
eighteen months before the loss of the <i>Captain</i>, the Admiralty,
in the presence of the increasing efficiency of steam machinery,
had decided to construct a mastless sea-going turret ship.</p>

<p>American experience greatly influenced this decision. In
America, where the principle of machinery for propulsion and
for working the guns had been accepted with a greater readiness
than in Europe, the line of development had been more direct.
From the original <i>Monitor</i> a whole series of derivatives had
been produced, and from coast-defence vessels of a single
turret advance had been made to ocean-going mastless turret
ships of low freeboard, carrying the largest smooth-bore guns.
These ocean monitors, lacking though they did some features
which were considered indispensable in British warships, yet
exerted an undoubted influence upon our own construction.
Weakly designed in many respects, with small fuel capacity,
and unsteady as gun platforms, they were regarded by some
writers as the true progenitors of the class of warship which
now superseded the masted vessels of the ’sixties.</p>

<p>The problem of the naval architect henceforth was greatly
simplified. Masts and sails, which had in the past proved
such an embarrassment, were now frankly abandoned, with
the result that a thousand difficulties which had beset the
designer of the turret ship were swept away. No longer had
the stability curve to conform to the conflicting requirements
of the sailing vessel and the gun platform. The large weight
gained by dispensing with masts and sails could be embodied
as an addition to the armament or to the fuel carried. The
single screw, which in the case of a ship intended to use sails
had been almost a necessity, could be replaced by twin screws
of greater power; and the change would remove the liability
of complete disablement, and give a number of constructive
advantages which it is unnecessary to enumerate. Indeed, it
may be said conversely, that the adoption of twin screws so
improved the reliability of the propelling machinery as to
make practicable the abandonment of masts and sails.</p>

<p>In April, 1869, the <i>Devastation</i> was commenced. Designed
by Sir Edward Reed, she “forestalled, rather than profited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
by, the dreadful lesson of the <i>Captain</i> and by her success gave
proof of the judgment and initiative of the Board and their
adviser.” Sir Edward Reed had recognized, more fully than
his critics, the conflicting elements inherent in the rigged
turret ship. And it is significant that, just at a time when the
assured success of the <i>Monarch</i> must have been a gratification
to her designer, he should record: “My clear and strong
conviction at the moment of writing these lines [March 31st,
1869] is that no satisfactorily designed turret ship with rigging
has yet been built, or even laid down.”</p>

<p>The <i>Devastation</i> design was a development of those of some
previous mastless turret ships, the <i>Cerberus</i>, the <i>Hotspur</i>, and
the <i>Glatton</i> class, which had embodied Sir Edward Reed’s
ideas as to the requirements of coast-service vessels. At first
given four 25-ton guns, the <i>Devastation</i> was ultimately armed
with four M.L. guns each weighing 35 tons and carried in
turrets on the centre-line, one at each end of a central breastwork,
150 feet in length, built round the funnels.</p>

<p>This central breastwork, raised above the upper deck and
armoured along its sides with 10-inch steel, supported the two
turrets and enabled the guns to be carried at a desirable height
above the water-line. The upper deck itself was low. The
sides, up to its level, were protected by a complete belt of
armour 8 inches in thickness.</p>

<p>The abolition of masts and rigging had a striking effect on the
design. Compared with the <i>Monarch</i>, of nearly the same
tonnage, she carried heavier guns, double the weight of
armour, double the amount of fuel, and required little more
than half the crew to work her.</p>

<p>The loss of the <i>Captain</i>, confirming the doubts which
experts had expressed as to the seaworthiness of rigged turret
ships, caused an alarm for the safety of all turret ships, built
and building. In the public mind, in consequence of the
reported shortcomings of the American monitors and the
known deficiencies of our coast-defence vessels, the belief was
growing that the turret system was inherently unsafe. It was
believed, also, that mastless ships, having no spread of sail to
steady their motion, would be liable to excessive and dangerous
rolling. To allay the uneasiness as to the safety of the <i>Devastation</i>
and her type a Committee on Designs was formed. The
Committee, composed of some of the most eminent of naval
architects and officers, made a report in the spring of ’71<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
which, though it met with considerable opposition from one
school, nevertheless “formed the groundwork upon which the
English Admiralty determined to construct their policy for
the future.” The Committee pronounced altogether against
fully rigged ships for the line of battle; it was impossible, in
their opinion, to combine in the same vessel great offensive
and defensive power and a full spread of canvas. They considered
the <i>Devastation</i> class as the most suitable type of
armoured ship for future service, and found them to have
sufficient stability for safety and to be in almost all respects
a satisfactory design of warship. As regards the <i>Devastation</i>
herself they recommended some minor alterations, the effect
of which was to improve the stability of the ship and to give
greater accommodation for the crew. The main alteration
consisted in the carrying up of the ship’s sides amidships to
the level of the central breastwork, and in continuing the
breastwork deck outward to the sides, to form unarmoured
side superstructures.</p>

<p>Besides the <i>Devastation</i>, two others of the type were laid
down shortly afterwards, the <i>Thunderer</i> and the <i>Dreadnought</i>.
The three ships differed from each other slightly in dimensions,
but embodied the same characteristic features. Of chief interest
is the transition of the unarmoured side superstructures,
in the <i>Devastation</i>, to an armoured central battery of the same
width as the ship, in the <i>Dreadnought</i>. The influence of Sir
Edward Reed, who had now given place to Mr. Nathaniel
Barnaby as Chief Constructor at the Admiralty, was apparent
in this evolution. In ’73 he stated publicly his objections to
the carrying up of the <i>Devastation’s</i> sides, and pictured a shell
entering the unarmoured superstructure and blowing up all
the light iron structure in front of the guns. The result was
seen in the <i>Dreadnought</i>, in which the breastwork was made a
continuation of the ship’s side and armoured. More freeboard
was also given to the forecastle and the after deck than was
found in the <i>Devastation</i> and <i>Thunderer</i>, with the desire to
make the vessel drier and more comfortable; and, owing to
the height at which the turrets were carried, this was found
possible without restricting the arcs of fire of the guns. The
movement from the monitor type toward the modern battleship
in respect of freeboard is clearly traced in these three
ships of the <i>Devastation</i> class. Low freeboard, in spite of its
effect in rendering inconspicuous the ship in which it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
embodied, was gradually being abandoned. High freeboard
was foreshadowed for future ships. The loss of the <i>Captain</i>
had led to a serious study, by naval architects and mathematicians,
of the stability of warships at large angles of rolling,
and the advantages of high freeboard were by this time widely
appreciated. High freeboard not only made a ship more
habitable; by the form of stability curve it gave it allowed
a vessel’s beam to be reduced with safety, and thereby contributed
to a steadier and more easily propelled ship than
would have been obtained without it.</p>

<p>In other respects these three ships show the lines along
which progress was being made. In the turrets of the <i>Devastation</i>
the twin 35-ton guns had been loaded and worked by
hand; but in the forward turret of the <i>Thunderer</i> the new
hydraulic system of Messrs. Armstrong was applied with
success to two 38-ton 12-inch guns; and this system was
adopted for both turrets of the <i>Dreadnought</i>. The guns were
loaded externally, the turrets being revolved by steam, after
firing, till the guns were on the requisite bearing; they were
then depressed by hydraulic power, and the 700-pound projectiles
were rammed into their muzzles by a telescopic
hydraulic rammer. In 1879 an accident occurred in the
<i>Thunderer</i> which helped, it is said, to hasten the return to
breech-loading guns. Simultaneous firing was being carried
out; one of the guns missed fire without anyone either inside
or outside the turret being aware of it. The guns were loaded
again, and, on being discharged, one of them burst. Such
double-loading, it was clearly seen, would not have obtained
with breech-loading guns.</p>

<p>The <i>Devastation</i> had twin screws driven by independent
engines, but these were non-compound engines of the trunk
type working with a maximum steam pressure of 30 lbs. per
square inch. In the <i>Dreadnought</i> an advance had been made
to compound the three-cylinder vertical engines, working with
60 lbs. per square inch in engine-rooms divided by a longitudinal
watertight bulkhead.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>The evolution of the battleship was being forced along at a
hot pace by the evolution of artillery. No sooner had the
mastless turret ship received the sanction of the Committee on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
Designs as the standard type for warfare of the immediate
future, than a sudden increase in the power of guns necessitated
the consideration of new principles and brought into being a
new type.</p>

<p>So far, defence had managed to compete fairly successfully
with offence; the naval architect, by devoting as much as
25 per cent of the total of a ship’s weight to protective armour,
had been able to keep level with the artillerist. But it was
clear that he could not follow much further, by the existing
methods. Armour could not be thickened indefinitely.
Penetrable armour was no better than none; worse, in fact,
since it was a superfluity, and in a ship a superfluity was
doubly wasteful, implying a loss of strength in some other
direction. Armour might have to go altogether? It seemed
that, after all, the predictions of Sir Howard Douglas might
well come true; that, just as gunpowder had forced the foot
soldier, after burdening him with an ever-increasing weight, to
dispense altogether with body-armour, so rifled artillery would
render ship armour increasingly ineffectual and, eventually,
an altogether useless encumbrance.</p>

<p>The advance in artillery took place in connection with
Italian construction. In 1872 Italy laid down the <i>Duilio</i>,
and a year later the <i>Dandolo</i>, two mastless turret ships of a
novel class, engined by Penn and Maudsley, and equipped
with two diagonally placed turrets each designed to carry two
60-ton Armstrong guns; guns which were afterwards changed
to 100-ton guns of 17¾ inches bore. In the same ships the
Italians introduced a solution of the armour difficulty. They
abandoned vertical armour altogether, except for a very thick
belt over the central portion of each vessel which was to
protect the vital machinery and the gun turrets.</p>

<p>The reply to these was the <i>Inflexible</i>, laid down in ’74.</p>

<p>We have already seen how, in the last of the <i>Devastation</i>
class, the central armoured breastwork was widened to the full
beam of the ship. It had been proposed by Mr. Barnaby to
take advantage of this arrangement to off-set the two turrets
of the <i>Dreadnought</i> at a distance each side of the centre line of
the ship, so as to allow a powerful ahead fire. Although not
then approved, this suggestion was embodied in the <i>Inflexible</i>
as her most distinctive feature. In this, however, she was
forestalled by the Italians. Her two turrets, each weighing
750 tons, were carried diagonally on a central armoured citadel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
plated with compound armour of a maximum thickness of
24 inches. Forward and aft of this citadel the unarmoured
ends were built flush with it, and along the centre line was
built, the whole length of the ship, a narrow superstructure.
This superstructure did not contribute anything to her
stability; nor was such contribution needed in view of the
comparatively high freeboard. But it rendered unnecessary
a flying deck such as had been fitted in the <i>Devastation</i> class, and
provided accommodation for the crew, without restricting to
any appreciable degree the arcs of fire of the big guns.</p>

<p>The <i>Inflexible</i> was of over 11,000 tons displacement, the
heaviest and most powerful warship that had ever been built.
She was 320 feet in length and 75 feet broad at the water-line;
this unprecedented beam being required, in spite of the high
freeboard, on account of the height at which the turrets
were carried. Nevertheless, so improved was her propulsive
efficiency as compared with that of former ships, so great the
gain resulting from Mr. Froude’s historic researches on ship
form and the action of propellers, that a speed of 15 knots was
obtained at a relatively small expense in horse-power.</p>

<p>The idea of sails was not yet altogether dead. In deference
to a strong naval opinion she was originally designed to carry
two pole masts, with sails for steadying her motion in a seaway
and as a standby in the event of her propelling machinery
being disabled. But this scheme was modified owing to the
possibility of falling masts and rigging interfering with the
working of guns and screw in action. It was decided that
she should be brig-rigged for peace service; and that, on
an anticipation of war, she should be docked to allow the
cruising masts to be removed and replaced by two short iron
masts without yards for signalling and for carrying crows’
nests.</p>

<p>But it was in the bold abandonment of armour for the ends
of the ship and its concentration on the sides of the citadel
that the <i>Inflexible</i> design was most freely criticized. Armour,
except in the form of an under-water protective deck, was not
used at all forward and aft of the citadel. The ends of the
ship were left unprotected, but subdivided; the compartments
near the water-line formed watertight tanks filled with
coals, stores, or—next to the side of the ship—cork. This
criticism was directed from two directions.</p>

<p>To many naval men the attempt to beat the gun by adding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
to the thickness of the armour was a game no longer worth the
candle. The point of view, moreover, that the defensive power
of a ship was accurately represented by the defensive power
of an armour patch upon its side was condemned as altogether
too partial and theoretical. The same fallacy was abroad in
respect of guns. “Men were apt to think and speak as if the
mounting of a single excessively heavy gun in a ship would
make her exceptionally powerful, no matter what number of
powerful, but still less powerful, guns were displaced to make
room for it. The targets and guns at Shoeburyness were held
to be real measures of the defensive and offensive powers of
ships.”<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, experience was at this time bringing to
light the inefficiency of heavy naval artillery. In ’71 a paper
by Captain Colomb attracted attention, in which he analysed
the effective gun power of the <i>Monarch</i>, and showed, by the
light of experiments carried out by her against a rock off Vigo
in company with <i>Captain</i> and <i>Hercules</i>, that “in six minutes
from the opening of her fire on the sister ship at 1000 yards, she
will have fired twelve shot, of which one will have hit and
another may have glanced, and it remains an even chance
whether the single hit will have penetrated the enemy’s
armour.” In the following summer Mr. Barnaby was himself
impressed with the difficulty which the <i>Hotspur</i> experienced in
hitting the turret of the <i>Glatton</i> at a range of 200 yards in
the smooth water of Portland Harbour: an experiment which,
while confirming confidence in the reliability of a turret and its
power to withstand shock, led him to question whether we were
wise to put so much weight into the protection of turrets, and
whether it might not be a better plan to stint armour on guns
in order to add to their number and power.</p>

<p>From another direction the criticism was more directly
effective. In ’75 Sir Edward Reed, now a private member of
parliament, made a pronouncement on his return from a visit
to Italy in the following words: “The Italian ships <i>Duilio</i>
and <i>Dandolo</i> are exposed, in my opinion, beyond all doubt or
question, to speedy destruction. I fear I can only express my
apprehension that the Italians are pursuing a totally wrong
course, and one which is likely to result in disaster.” The
Italian Minister of Marine indignantly refuted the assertion,
based as it must have been (he said) on incomplete information;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
and the construction of the <i>Duilio</i> and the <i>Dandolo</i>
proceeded. But the remarks of the ex-Chief Constructor
applied with equal force to the <i>Inflexible</i>; and in the following
session he stated as much in the House of Commons. It was
possible, he insisted, that in an action the cork and stores
which filled the unarmoured ends of the <i>Inflexible</i> might be shot
away, and the ends riddled and water-logged; and that in
such an event the citadel, though intact, would not have
sufficient stability to save the ship from capsizing.</p>

<p>The reply of the Admiralty was to the effect that Sir Edward
Reed had assumed an extreme case, and that such a complete
destruction as he had envisaged was, even if possible, never
likely to occur in a naval action.</p>

<p>The effect of both statements was to cause widespread
anxiety in the public mind, and a lamentable loss of confidence
in the projected warship. A decision was therefore made
to appoint another Committee, of unquestioned eminence and
freedom from bias, to investigate and report on the <i>Inflexible</i>
design. In due course the Committee reported. They confirmed
in a long statement the Admiralty point of view that
the complete penetration and water-logging of the unarmoured
ends of the ship, and the blowing out of the whole of the stores
and the cork by the action of shell fire, was a very highly
improbable contingency; they found that the ship, if reduced
to the extremest limit of instability likely to occur, viz. with
her ends completely riddled and water-logged, but with the
stores and cork remaining and adding buoyancy, would still
possess a sufficient reserve both of buoyancy and of stability;
and, balancing the vulnerability of the citadel with its 24-inch
armour and the destructibility of the unarmoured ends, they
came to the conclusion that the unarmoured ends were as well
able as the armoured citadel to bear the part assigned to them
in encountering the risks of naval warfare, and that therefore a
just balance had been maintained in the design, so that out of a
given set of conditions a good result had been obtained. Except
that a recommendation was made that the system of cork
chambers should be extended, no structural alteration from the
existing design was proposed.</p>

<p>The <i>Inflexible</i> was followed by its smaller derivatives, the
<i>Ajax</i> and <i>Agamemnon</i>, <i>Colossus</i> and <i>Edinburgh</i>, and by the
<i>Conqueror</i>, an improved <i>Rupert</i>, with a single turret. Movement
was in the direction of smaller displacements and less armour;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
construction was influenced at this time more by Italian than
by French practice.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>All through this transitional decade, 1870–80, experience and
various new developments were imperceptibly causing a
gradual change of opinion as to what constituted the best type
of battleship. At no period, perhaps, was the warship more
obviously a compromise, at no time were the limitations of size
and weight more keenly felt. So many considerations interacted
with one another, so conflicting were the claims made of
the naval architect, that it appeared indeed almost impossible
to embody them in a satisfactory design. (And yet nothing is
more remarkable than the unanimity with which designers,
given certain conditions, arrived at the same final result: the
<i>Duilio</i> and the <i>Inflexible</i> are a case in point.) Whatever the
design might be, it was open to powerful criticism. And the
chief part of this criticism was directed, as we have seen, against
the use and disposition of the armour.</p>

<p>In ’73 Mr. Barnaby had questioned the wisdom of expending
a large weight in the protection of turrets. Three years later
Commander Noel, in a Prize Essay, was advocating unarmoured
batteries, with a view to multiplying the number of
battery guns, utilizing for offence the weight thus saved. In
’73 Mr. Barnaby had argued that the stinting of armour on the
hull in order to thicken it on the battery would drive the enemy
to multiply his light and medium machine-guns. Within a
few years warships were bristling with Gatling and Gardner,
Nordenfelt and Hotchkiss guns, which by their presence gave a
new value to armour, however thin. Mr. Froude, too, in his
experiments in connection with the <i>Inflexible</i>, brought into
prominence the advantage which thin armour on a ship’s ends
conferred on her stability. The idea of substituting cellular
construction for armour was proving attractive. While the
French continued to favour the complete water-line belt, the
Italians went to the limit in the <i>Italia</i> and <i>Lepanto</i>, in which
the water-line was left entirely unprotected by side armour.
Such armour as was carried was embodied in the form of a
protective deck, a feature found above water and in conjunction
with a side belt in our <i>Devastation</i> class, and under water
and without side armour in the <i>Inflexible</i> and smaller contemporary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
ships. The protective deck, which covered the
vitals of a ship and deflected shot and shell from its surface,
was a device which found increasing favour with naval
architects. It was advocated by the Committee on Designs in
’71 as possessing important advantages over a similar weight
of side armour. If placed at some distance below water it
formed the roof of a submerged hull structure which was
immune from damage by gun-fire, the sides of this hull being
protected sufficiently by sea-water. If, as was subsequently
done, the protective deck were placed at a small distance above
water, and if the sides of it were bent down so as to meet the
ship’s sides at a distance below water beyond which a shot was
unlikely to penetrate, the deck offered other advantages: the
vital machinery, though now partly above water, was still
protected, the sloping parts of the deck being able to deflect
shots which would have penetrated a much thicker vertical
plate; moreover, if the ship’s sides were riddled in action, the
protective deck still preserved a large portion of the water-line
area intact, and thereby secured her lateral stability.</p>

<p>The ram was still in favour, but opinion was slowly changing
as to the necessity for bow-fire. “It is my impression,” wrote
Commander Noel in ’76, “that too great a value was attached
by some of the authorities, two or three years ago, to bow-fire;
and that the manœuvring of a fleet in action will be more for the
purpose of using the ram effectually, and the guns in broadsides
on passing the enemy.” The firing of the heavy guns in
the approach to ram was considered undesirable, owing to the
obscuring of the scene by smoke. In short, bow-fire was not
of primary importance, and the disposition of armament which
sought to obtain a concentration of bow-fire at the expense of
broadside fire was based on a false principle. Commander Noel
advocated a broadside ship, of moderate tonnage, with an
unarmoured battery of moderate-size guns, with an armour
belt round her water-line of 10-inch armour tapering to 5 inches
forward and aft, and backed by wood and coal. Watertight
subdivisions he proposed as a defence against the ram and the
torpedo.</p>

<p>As the decade progressed the navy and naval affairs were
less and less a subject of public interest. The design of warships
continued to be discussed by a small circle, but the
Board, alive to the transitional nature of the citadel ships, and
under the influence of a national movement for retrenchment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
and economy, had almost ceased to build. In the three years
’76, ’77, and ’78 England laid down only two armoured battleships,
while France laid down a dozen. In ’78 four foreign ships
building in this country were hastily purchased on a Vote of
Credit. But by 1880 the French armoured navy was once more
equal in strength to that of England.</p>

<p>The gun, by its rapid evolution, was blocking design. The
long debates over sails and steam had been settled; it was
now the achievement of powerful breech-loading guns of large
and small calibre which threw all existing ideas of warship
design into the melting-pot. It became known that the French
at last possessed efficient breech-loading guns; and artillerists
showed that, in spite of the inconvenience of long-barrelled
guns in ships, long barrels and slow-burning powder were
necessary if greater powers were to be developed, and that our
short-barrelled muzzle-loaders were already becoming obsolete.
In the summer of ’79 public interest was aroused by the arrival
at Spithead of some Chinese gunboats built by the firm of
Armstrong. These gunboats each carried two 12-ton breech-loading
guns mounted on centre pivots, one forward and one
aft: guns so powerful and efficient compared with any mounted
in the Royal Navy, that the possibilities of the diminutive craft
were instantly appreciated. The contest between B.L. and
M.L. was approaching a climax. The 100-ton M.L. gun was
undergoing proof at Woolwich. In August a committee of naval
officers visited Germany to witness and report upon the trials
of Krupp’s new breech-loaders, and these trials, and those of
Armstrong in this country, confirmed the formidable character
of the new ordnance. Armour was also improving its power;
compound armour (of combined steel and iron) was found to
possess unexpected powers of resistance to penetration.</p>

<p>The torpedo, moreover, in its growing efficiency was now
beginning to have an effect, not only on the details of ship
design, but on the whole nature of naval warfare. The
influence of the torpedo in its various forms had been appreciated
in the early days of the decade.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> The catastrophic but,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
happily, fictitious Battle of Dorking, fought in the pages of
<cite>Blackwood’s Magazine</cite> in 1871, had been preceded by a naval
action in which all but one of our fine ironclads had been sunk
by torpedoes in attempting to ram the French fleet. The
moral was obvious. From that time onwards the potential
effect of the torpedo was seen to be very great. The ram
seemed at last to have found a check. And it appeared that,
in combating the ram, the torpedo had once more given the
primacy to the fast-improving gun. Broadside actions of the
old type, carried on at high range and speed, were predicted.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<p>In 1880 a new type of battleship was evolved of sufficient
permanence to form the basis of whole classes of future ships.</p>

<p>An intimate account of the genesis of the <i>Collingwood</i> design
is given us by the biographer of Sir Cooper Key, to illustrate
the manner in which that prescient administrator succeeded in
forecasting the trend of future construction. In ’66, he says,
Captain Key had put on paper a résumé of his ideas on warship
design which was clearly several years in advance of current
opinion. Briefly, he had maintained that the specifications for
our first-class battleships of the future should be drawn to
cover the following features so far as possible:—moderate
speed, small length and great handiness; perfect protection
for vital parts and a complete water-line belt, rather than
protection for personnel and above-water structure; a main-deck
armament of broadside guns of medium calibre amidships,
and of lighter calibre towards the ends, in combination with
an upper-deck armament of four large guns in two unarmoured
barbettes, one mounted before the foremast and one abaft the
mizzen-mast; no sails. But for some years no approach was
made to this ideal ship of Captain Key’s; the ideas it embodied
were antagonistic to those held by the great majority of his
brother officers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
“In 1878 there had been laid down by the French, at Toulon,
a ship called the <i>Caiman</i>. She was 278 feet long, and had a
speed of 14½ knots. She carried a single 42-cm. breech-loading
rifled gun at the bow, and another at the stern, each mounted <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en
barbette</i>, and she further carried on each broadside, between the
barbettes, two 10-cm. guns, besides machine-guns. She was
heavily armoured by a water-line belt 19½ inches thick amidships,
and tapering in thickness towards bow and stern. The
middle part of the ship, between the barbettes, was further
protected by a steel deck 2·8 inches thick. Evidently, there
was in this ship some approach to that general ideal which had
been in Sir Cooper Key’s mind in 1866—not, however, more
than this. She gave a sort of hint to the constructors at the
Admiralty, and, before Sir Cooper Key joined the Board, a
new design, based indeed on the <i>Caiman’s</i> hint, but yet
differing widely from her, and, by as much as she differed,
approaching more nearly to Sir Cooper Key’s ideal, was in
process of completion there. The ship was the <i>Collingwood</i>.”</p>

<p>The <i>Collingwood</i> was of 9150 tons displacement, 325 feet in
length, 68 feet in breadth, and 15·7 knots speed. There was
in her, for the first time in the navy, that particular disposition
of guns which Captain Key had recommended in ’66: two
guns at bow, two at stern, on turntables, and a strong broadside
armament between them. In the end the adoption of a
breech-loading system led to a larger barbette and a smaller
battery armament: to 43-ton guns at bow and stern and only
6-inch guns on the broadsides; and in this way the final design
differed more than did the original from the ’66 ideal. “The
bow and stern guns were protected by barbette and other
armour, but Key had required that some protection should be
given to the turntables and the machinery for working them.
Hydraulics had greatly increased the quantity and importance
of this machinery, and as by its means the crews of the guns
were very much diminished, we can imagine the admiral
concurring in the change as a natural development of his
principle. So we can understand him as now definitely
concurring in the abandonment of sail power for first-class
battleships.” In ’78 he had flown his flag in the <i>Thunderer</i> at
sea, and he had then experienced the reliability of the gun
machinery and the difficulties attendant on the manœuvring
of a modern fleet under sail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
Both in armament and in disposition of armour the <i>Collingwood</i>
was a great but a natural advance on the citadel ships of
the <i>Inflexible</i> type. The symmetrical placing of the big gun
turntables, one forward and one aft, proclaimed the advent of
new tactical ideas—the recognition of the battleship as a unit
which must take its place in the line with others, and the
rejection of “end-on” methods of fighting which involved a
concentration of bow-fire. The provision of the powerful
secondary armament was a tribute to the growing efficiency
of French torpedo craft, while at the same time serving,
offensively, to force an enemy to protect himself against it:
to spread his armour over as large a surface as possible in the
attempt to preserve his stability in a protracted action. The
concentration of armour on the fixed barbettes and on a partial
belt over the central portion of the ship was in accordance
with the <i>Inflexible</i> arrangement. But, in consequence of the
strictures which had been passed on that vessel and on the
exposure of her large unprotected ends, the <i>Collingwood</i> was
given a longer belt, though not so thick. Fifty-four per cent
of her length was covered with 18-inch compound armour, as
compared with 42 per cent, and 24-inch armour, in the former
ship. Although this longer belt appeared to confer greater
longitudinal stability on the ship, its narrowness was such
that it was of doubtful efficacy, as Sir Edward Reed was not
slow to point out. So narrow was this belt, so big still remained
the unarmoured ends, that the slight sinkage caused
by their filling would bring the whole of the armour belt, he
said, under water. Thus all the advantage arising from a
longer citadel was more than destroyed by this lowering of
the armour, and, so great was the consequent danger of the
vessel capsizing, that he hesitated to regard the <i>Collingwood</i>
as an armoured ship.</p>

<p>The <i>Collingwood</i> was laid down in July, 1880. But what was
there to show that her design would be in any degree permanent?
Was it safe to consider it sufficiently satisfactory to
form the master-pattern for a number of new ships, urgently
required?</p>

<p>For a short time there was uncertainty. “The French type,
where there were isolated armoured barbette towers generally
containing single heavy guns placed at the ends and sides of
the ships upon the upper deck, with broadside batteries of
lighter guns, entirely unprotected by armour, upon the deck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
below, did not commend itself to the English naval mind, yet,
in the sort of despair which possessed us, the new Board
turned somewhat towards the French system. The <i>Warspite</i>
and <i>Impérieuse</i> were laid down in 1881, and were again a new
departure in British design.... It was intended to adhere to
sail power in these new types, and it was only after they were
approaching completion that the utter incongruity of the
proposal was realized, and sail power was given up in the last
of the armoured ships to which it was attempted to apply it.”</p>

<p>But the Admiralty still wished, without alarming the public,
to regain as soon as possible a safe balance of armoured construction
over that of France. “There was no design before
the Board which was more likely to perpetuate itself than that
of the unlaunched <i>Collingwood</i>. Suppose a bold policy were
adopted? Suppose it were assumed that the time had come
when diversities of type were to cease, would it be made less
likely by the frank abandonment of sail power?”</p>

<p>The bold step was taken. Four more ships to the <i>Collingwood</i>
design were laid down in ’82, the five being thereafter
spoken of as the “Admiral” class. “At the time, little note was
taken of this very great step in advance. Even at this day
it is scarcely remembered that this is the step which made
possible, and led up to, our present great battle fleet, and that
never before had so many as five first-class ironclads of a
definite type been on the stocks together.... In the Admiral
class there was the definite parting with sail power, the rejection
of the tactical ideas brought to a climax in the <i>Inflexible</i>,
and, above all, the definite adoption of the long-barrelled
breech-loading rifled gun. Without question, we must say
that we owe the Admiral class, and all that has followed, in
great part to the enterprising and yet well-balanced mind
that then governed the naval part of the Council at Whitehall.”</p>

<p class="p2 center">§</p>

<p>At this point in the evolution of the ironclad it is convenient
to bring our survey to an end. The <i>Collingwood</i>
marks the final return (with one or two notorious exceptions)
to the truly broadside ship, the ship with armament symmetrically
disposed fore and aft, intended to fight with others
in the line. From the Admiral class onwards the modern
battleship evolved for years along a continuous and clearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
defined curve of progression. It only remains to close this
brief and necessarily superficial historical sketch with a few
remarks upon the classification of warships.</p>

<p>In tracing the types of ironclads which superseded each
other in direct succession, no mention has been made of other
than those which formed in their time the chief units of naval
force. Other war-vessels there were, of course, subsidiary to
the main fighting force, whose value and functions we now
briefly indicate.</p>

<p>So long as sails remained the sole motive power, warships
retained the same classification as they had received in the
seventeenth century. “Up to the time of the Dutch Wars,”
says Admiral Colomb, “ships were both ‘royal’ and of private
contribution; of all sorts and sizes and ‘rates.’ Fighting was
therefore promiscuous. Fleets sailed in the form of half-moons,
or all heaped together and, except for the struggle to
get the weather gage, there were no tactics. Actions were
general.” Then, in order to protect their fleets from the fire
ship, the Dutch first introduced the Line of Battle: “in
which formation it was easy for a fleet to leeward to open out
so as to let a fire ship drift harmlessly through.” And so the
efficacy of the fire ship was destroyed. “But now, with a
Line, each ship had a definite place which she could not quit.
Hence the diversities in sizes began to be eliminated. The
weakest ships, which might find themselves opposite the
strongest, were dropped for ships ‘fit to lie in the line,’ i.e.
for what were afterwards called ‘line-of-battle ships.’ These
ships would be individually as powerful as possible, only
subject to the objection of putting too many eggs in one
basket. Uniformity would thus be attained. The fleet of line
ships, however, required look-outs or scouts, which could keep
the seas and attend, yet out-sail, the fleet. Hence the heavy
frigate. Lastly, there was the much lighter attendant on
commerce (either by way of attack or defence), the light
cruiser.”</p>

<p>Although this differentiation of types was based ostensibly
upon displacement or tonnage, in reality it was formed on a
more scientific basis. Admiral Sir George Elliot demonstrated,
in 1867, that the real basis was not a rule of size, but a <em>law of
safety</em>, similar to that which operates in the natural world; a
law so important that it should under no circumstances be
disregarded. He showed that sailing ships conformed to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
law. He showed that the reduction of a vessel’s size, for
instance, endowed her with smaller draught and an increased
speed; that the dispensing with one quality automatically
gave another in compensation; and that thus the weakly
armed vessel always possessed the means, if not to fight, to
escape from capture.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p>

<p>With the coming of steam and armour, all this was
changed. Size had now no inherent disability; on the contrary,
the larger the ship the greater the horse-power which
could be carried in her, the greater her probable speed and
sea endurance. The small ship had no advantages. The old
classification had clearly broken down. The first ironclads,
the <i>Warrior</i> and her successors, although of frigate form,
belonged to no particular class; they were of a special type
intended to cope with the most powerful ships afloat or projected;
and subsequent ships were designed with the same
end in view. These ships being faster as well as more powerful
than those of a smaller size, there was no object in attempting to
build others of a frigate class for the purpose of outsailing them.</p>

<p>As material developed, and as the warship became more
and more obviously a compromise between conflicting qualities,
differentiation of types was once more seen to be necessary.
Attempts were made to classify on the bases of displacement,
material, defensive and motive power, service, system of armament.
In the end British construction divided itself into two
categories: armoured and unarmoured vessels. And each of
these categories was subdivided into classes of ships analogous
to those of the old sailing ships.</p>

<p>But, during the transitional period 1860 to 1880, when
armour and iron ships, steam engines, rifled guns, and fish
torpedoes, were all in their infancy and subject to the most
rapid development, no such classification was recognized.
The circumstances of the Crimean War, with the adoption of
armour and the sudden and enormous growth in the unit of
artillery force which took place soon afterwards, led to the
first differentiation of ironclads, into ocean-going and coast-defence
vessels. We have already noted this fact. We have
seen how, especially to the lesser Powers, the turreted monitor
appeared to offer an economical and effective form of naval
force; and we have noted how, in America, the evolution
proceeded in the opposite direction, viz. from coast-defence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
monitor to ocean-going turret ship. This differentiation
prevailed for many years. It prevailed even in the British
navy, in spite of its being in full opposition to the offensive
principle on which that navy had always based its policy.</p>

<p>Later, although convinced that in any war involving this
country and its colonies the chief combats must be fought in
European waters, naval opinion saw the necessity for a type
of ship designed primarily for the defence and attack of
commerce: a speedy, lightly armed and protected type
capable of overhauling and injuring a weaker, or of escaping
from a more powerful enemy. The American War of ’62, in
which no general sea action was fought, gave the impulse to
the construction of the type which eventually became known
as the <em>cruiser</em>. Vessels were built in ’63 expressly to overtake
Confederate vessels and drive from the seas the Southern
mercantile marine. These vessels were to annihilate the
enemy’s commerce without being drawn themselves to take
part in an engagement, unless in very favourable circumstances.
Several such ships were built. The first, the <i>Idaho</i>,
was a complete failure; the next attempt was little more
successful; and those subsequently constructed, the <i>Wampanoag</i>
class, the finest ships of the type which existed at the
close of the war, which were designed for 17 knots and to
carry sixteen 10- or 11-inch smooth-bore cast-iron guns on the
broadside and a revolving 60-pounder rifle in the bows, suffered
from miscalculations in design and from the weakness peculiar
to long and heavily weighted timber-built ships. “These
pioneers of the type,” says Brassey, “were followed, both in
England and in France, by vessels believed by the builders of
their respective countries to be better adapted for the work
for which they were designed.”</p>

<p>At first England and France had built and appropriated
small ironclads to this secondary service; in France the
<i>Belliqueuse</i>, in England the <i>Pallas</i>, were designed to this end.
But in ’66 the first ship of the cruiser type was built for the
British navy: the <i>Inconstant</i>, of Sir Edward Reed’s design,
an iron-built, fine-lined vessel with a speed of 16 knots and a
large coal capacity. She was followed by the corvettes <i>Active</i>
and <i>Volage</i>, and then, in ’73, by the <i>Shah</i> and <i>Raleigh</i>. Experience
with the early cruisers showed the advantages of
large displacement. “The greater number of the American
corvettes had now been launched. A trial of one of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
showed that the high hopes which had been entertained of
their performance were fallacious. It now appeared no longer
necessary that the English corvettes should possess such
extraordinary power and speed, qualities which necessarily
required very large displacements. The Admiralty, however,
still believing in the wisdom of the policy which they had
previously adopted, decided to follow a totally different course
from that which all other navies had been compelled by
financial considerations to follow. So far from diminishing the
size of their ships, increased displacement was given to the
new designs.”<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> Full sail power was still required, for the high-power
steam engine used by the cruiser for fighting purposes
was most uneconomical. The <i>Raleigh</i>, for instance, burned
her six hundred tons of coal in less than 36 hours, at full speed.</p>

<p>But after the <i>Raleigh</i> came a slight reaction. With a view
to economy a smaller type of vessel was designed, the smallest
possible vessel which could be contrived which would possess
a covered-in gun deck in combination with other features
considered essential in a frigate class; the result was the
<i>Boadicea</i> or the <i>Bacchante</i> class. In the late ’seventies size
again increased, and the <i>Iris</i> and <i>Mercury</i>, unsheathed vessels
of steel, with coal-protection for their water-line and extended
watertight subdivision of the hull, were laid down.</p>

<p>From the unarmoured, unprotected cruiser was in time
evolved, by the competition of units, the armoured cruiser.
Russia led the way. Her <i>General-Admiral</i>, the first belted
cruiser, was built to compete with the <i>Raleigh</i> and <i>Boadicea</i>.
Then England designed the <i>Shannon</i>, partially belted and
with protective deck and coal protection, to outmatch her.
Eventually the cleavage came, and the cruisers were themselves
divided into two or more classes, in accordance with
their duties, size and fitness for the line of battle.</p>

<p>Of the development of torpedo craft this is not the place
to write; although the torpedo was fast growing in efficiency
and importance, it had not, before 1880, become the centre
and cause of a special craft and a special system for its employment
in action. But after that date the creation of torpedo
flotillas began to exercise a marked and continuous effect
upon the evolution of the ironclad. The fish-torpedo, improving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
at a phenomenal rate in the first years of its development,
and at first esteemed as of defensive value and as a
counter to the ram, became, after 1880, an offensive weapon
of the first importance. The ram, already suspected of being
placed too high in popular estimation, suffered a decline; the
danger of its use in action was emphasized by naval officers,
whose opinion alone was decisive: its use, as an eminent
tactician explained, reduced the chances of battle to a mere
toss-up, since there was “only half a ship’s length between
ramming and being rammed.” The gun developed in power,
in range, and accuracy; but not (up to the end of the century)
at so great a rate as its rival, the torpedo. The steam engine
affected all weapons by its continuous development. It depressed
the ram, enhanced the importance of the gun, and
endowed the torpedo with a large accession of potential value
in placing it, in its special fast sea-going craft, within reach of
the battleship; moreover, it enabled the cruiser to regain its
old supremacy of speed over the line-of-battle unit. Armour,
quick-firing guns, secondary armament, watertight construction,
net defence, all influenced the development of the various
types. But it was the torpedo, borne into action by the high-speed
steam engine, which had the greatest effect on naval
types in the last two decades of the century, and which at one
time bid fair to cause a constructional revolution as great as
that of 1860. The torpedo, according to a school of French
enthusiasts, had destroyed the ironclad battleship and dealt a
heavy blow at English sea power by paving the way for an
inexpensive navy designed for a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">guerre de course</i>. The ironclad
was dead, they cried, and might as well be placed in the
Louvre museum along with the old three-deckers! In Italy
and Germany, too, the logic of facts seemed to point to a vast
depreciation in the power of existing navies: the fate of the
expensive ironclad seemed assured, in the presence of small,
fast, sea going torpedo-boats. Still, it was noticed, England
laid down battleships. True; this was quite in keeping with her
machiavellian policy. Had she not resisted—“not blindly, but
with a profound clairvoyance”—all the inventions of the century?
Had she not successfully baulked the development of
Fulton’s mines, steam navigation, the shell gun, and the
ironclad itself? And, now that steam had made the blockade
impossible and the torpedo had attacked the ironclad effectually,
making sea-supremacy an empty term, could not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
British Empire be destroyed by taking the choice of weapons
out of England’s hands?</p>

<p>The prospect was alluring. Yet the ironclad survived the
menace and remained the standard unit of naval power. Expensive,
designed with several aims and essentially complex,—a
compromise, like man himself,—it could not be replaced
by a number of small, cheap, uni-functional vessels, each constructed
for one sole and special purpose, without loss of
efficiency and concentration of power. Nor could it be supplanted
by a type which, like the sea-going torpedo-boat, could
only count on an ascendancy over it in certain moments of its
own choosing—for example, at night-time or in a fog. To
every novel species of attack the ironclad proved superior,
calling to its aid the appropriate defensive measures.</p>

a Mr. Taylor gave the following evidence: “I found him (Mr. Miller) a
gentleman of great patriotism, generosity, and philanthropy; and at the same
time of a very speculative turn of mind. Before I knew him (1785) he had
gone through a very long and expensive course of experiments upon artillery
of which the carronade was the result.”</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_86" href="#FNanchor_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> On April 20th, 1669, Mr. Pepys recorded in his diary a visit to “the
Old Artillery-ground near the Spitalfields” to see a new gun “which, from
the shortness and bigness, they do call Punchinello.” Tried against a gun of
double its own length, weight, and powder-charge, Punchinello shot truer to
a mark and was easier to manage and had no greater recoil—to the great
regret of the old gunners and officers of the ordnance that were there.
</p>
<p>
The gallant inventor offered Mr. Pepys a share in the profits; there seemed
great promise that the king would favour it for naval use. “And,” adds
Pepys, “no doubt but it will be of profit to merchantmen and others to have
guns of the same form at half the charge.”</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_92" href="#FNanchor_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> It was evidently a practice at this period to vary the diameter of the
trucks to suit the ship’s structure and the height of the gun-ports. “Be
careful,” says Bourne in 1587, “that the trucks be not too high, for if the
trucks be too high, then it will keep the carriage that it will not go close
against the ship’s side.... And the truck being very high, it is not a small
thing under a truck that will stay it, etc. etc. And also, if that the truck be
too high, it will cause the piece to have the greater reverse or recoil. Therefore,
the lower that the trucks be, it is the better.”

Bourne also mentions, in the same book, the <cite>Art of Shooting in Great

The letter is unfavourable to the invention on the ground that, as ships
should always be at such close quarters with their enemies that missing
becomes impossible, such appliances would be superfluous. But in this
connection the observation is made that, with the degree of accuracy of guns
up to the nineteenth century a rough “line of metal” aim was probably all
that was justified, in the matter of sighting. In other words, with one element
of the system (the gun) so very inaccurate, nothing was to be gained by
increasing the accuracy of another element (the sight) to a disproportionate
degree. With increasing accuracy of the gun, increasing accuracy of sight
was called for.</p></div>

so that the drillings can easily work their way out of the hole. When, however,
it was desired to make the shank almost of the same diameter as the hole,
so as to form a guide, it was necessary to flute it with two grooves or more
to allow the drillings to get away. In the course of its evolution these
grooves became spiral.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_128" href="#FNanchor_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> The sudden and extraordinary development of rifled ordnance which now
took place had a revolutionary effect not only on naval architecture and
gunnery but on land fortification. In ’59 Sir William Armstrong, giving
evidence before a committee appointed by the War Secretary, stated that he
could attain with a specially constructed gun a range of five miles. The
statement made a sensation; for in the presence of such a gun most of the
existing defences of our dockyards and depots were almost useless. A Commission
on National Defence was formed. It reported that new fortifications
were necessary for our principal arsenals, the fleet alone being insufficient for
the defence of ports. “The introduction of steam,” stated the report, “may
operate to our disadvantage in diminishing to some extent the value of
superior seamanship; the practice of firing shells horizontally, and the
enormous extent to which the power and accuracy of aim of artillery have
been increased, lead to the conclusion that after an action even a victorious
fleet would be more seriously crippled and therefore a longer time unfit for
service.” Thus the command of the Channel might be temporarily lost.
As steam facilitated invasion, the immediate fortification of vital points on
the South Coast was considered necessary. In short, faith in the mobile fleet
was temporarily abandoned.
</p>
<p>
The recommendations of the Commission were carried out almost in their
entirety. In the case of Portsmouth, for instance, the reinforcement of the
Hilsea Lines, decided on only two years previously, was suspended in favour
of a defence of far greater radius—a circle of forts some of which were designed
to prevent an enemy from gaining possession, from the land side, of Portsdown
Hill, a ridge less than five miles from the Dockyard and therefore a
position from which, with the new artillery, the Dockyard could be bombarded.
A similar girdle of defences was given to Plymouth.</p></div>

per minute, was run against the <i>Widgeon</i>, the fastest paddlewheel steamer on
the Dover station. Two points of importance were noted by the Admiralty
representatives with reference to the propelling machinery of the <i>Archimedes</i>:
the objectionable noise made by the spur-wheels, and their liability to damage
and derangement. As, however, Mr. Smith proposed to obviate this objection
“by substituting spiral gearing in lieu of the cogs” the representatives did
not lay stress on these disadvantages.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_156" href="#FNanchor_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> A similar paradox was accidentally revealed in the case of the paddlewheel.
It was at first thought that, the broader the floats the greater would
be the pull. A certain steam vessel, however, being found to have too much
beam to allow her to pass into a lock, was altered by having her floats and
paddle-boxes made narrower. It was found that her speed had thereby been
improved (Otway).</p></div>

machinery revealed the enormous industrial capacity of this country, and
constituted a feat of which the whole nation was rightly proud. For instance
of successful organization, Messrs. Penn of Greenwich contracted to build
eighty sets of main engines in three months—a proposition ridiculed as
impossible. By the rapid distribution of duplicate patterns throughout the
country the resources of all the greatest firms were utilized, and the contract
was fulfilled almost to the day!
</p>
<p>
Some seven or eight years later, when the building of ironclads was being
debated in parliament, the government was able to recall this achievement
as an argument for not building too many ships of a new and probably
transitional type. If we liked, it was said, we could soon produce a fleet of
ironclads far greater than all the other Powers of Europe besides.</p></div>

here the <i>Temeraire</i>, built at Chatham and completed in 1877: a compromise
between the central-battery and the turret ship. Generally like the <i>Alexandra</i>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_171" href="#FNanchor_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> Hitherto the torpedo had been used in warfare only in the form of a
stationary mine, or motion had been given to it either by letting it drift on a
tide or by attaching it rigidly to the bow of a vessel. After the American
Civil War, in which conflict three-fourths of the ships disabled or destroyed
were so disposed of by torpedoes, efforts were made to give motion to it,
either by towing or by self-propulsion. In ’69 Commander Harvey, R.N.,
brought to the notice of the Admiralty his invention of a torpedo or sea kite
which was so shaped that, when launched from the deck of a steamer and
towed by a wire, it diverged from the steamer’s track and stood away at an
angle of 45°. It could be exploded either electrically or by contact. The
possibilities of this weapon were illustrated in a volume published in ’71,
one picture of which showed luridly “an ironclad fleet surprised at sea by a
squadron of torpedo craft armed with Harvey’s sea torpedoes.”
</p>
<p>
The towed torpedo was overshadowed by the fish or self-propelled torpedo.
In ’70 Mr. Whitehead came to England and, prosecuting experiments under
the eyes of naval officers, with a 16-inch torpedo successfully sank an old
corvette anchored in the Medway at 136 yards’ range. The result was the
purchase by the Admiralty of his secret and sole rights. In ’77 the first
torpedo-boat was ordered.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
